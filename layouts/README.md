# Screen Layouts
A screen layout combines xBlocks to fill a technical need (displaying a video with text, delivering an LR, providing an interactive experience). We put content (learning resources) into the template's placeholders to rapidly create high-quality learning experiences. 

Screen layouts are used to compose [learning activities](../activities/README.md).
