# Scientific Method

The scientific method is a systematic process that scientists use to observe, test, and verify hypotheses. It is the foundation of scientific research and experimentation. 

While there is no single scientific method with a "fixed sequence of steps" (AAAS, 2001 p. 18), the following process can serve as a rough guide for scientific inquiry-based learning at Western Governors University.

## Pattern Structure

### Observation

The first step of the scientific method is observation. This can be done through direct observation or indirect observation. Direct observation is when you observe something yourself, while indirect observation is when you gather information from secondary sources. Either way, it is important to gather as much information as possible about your topic of interest. Once you have gathered all of your data, you can begin to formulate a hypothesis. 

### Preliminary Background Research

Preliminary background research involves reading up on your topic of interest to gain a better understanding of the current state of knowledge. This step is important because it helps you to develop a hypothesis that is based on existing knowledge. It also helps you to design an experiment that will test your hypothesis. 

### Hypothesis

A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. In order to be considered a scientific hypothesis, it must be testable. This means that it must be possible to design an experiment that can prove or disprove the hypothesis. 

### Experiment

Once you have a testable hypothesis, you can design an experiment to test it. The design of the experiment will depend on the type of data that you are trying to collect.

### Collection Data

There are many different ways to collect data. You can use surveys, interviews, observations, or experiments. It is important to choose the method that is best suited for your research question. 

### Analyze Data

After you have collected your data, it is time to analyze it. This step will involve looking for patterns and trends in the data. You will also try to determine what the data means in relation to your research question. 

### Draw Conclusions

Once you have analyzed your data, you can draw conclusions about your hypothesis. If the data supports your hypothesis, then you can say that it is supported. If the data does not support your hypothesis, then you will need to modify your hypothesis or design a new experiment.
