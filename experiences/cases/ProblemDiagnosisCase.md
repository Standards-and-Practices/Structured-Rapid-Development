# Problem-Diagnosis Case
Across disciplines, qualified professionals are distinguished by their ability to diagnose and solve problems in a variety of circumstances. 

The learner's objective in a Problem-Diagnosis Case is to: 
1. Identify the root cause of the problem
2. Evaluate potential solutions using a criteria-based approach
3. Plan for contingencies
4. Recommend the best course of action
