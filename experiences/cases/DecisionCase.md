# Decision Case
Helping learners step into the shoes of a decision maker during a critical moment of decision can be an engaging way to teach both subject-matter and critical thinking. Decision-based cases are the most common type of case study.

# Pattern Structure
A learning experience implementing the Decision Case pattern typically follows the structure:

```mermaid
  flowchart LR;
      A[Explore a case]-->B[Identify options];
      B[Identify options]-->C[Explore options];
      C[Explore options]-->D[Make a decision];
      D[Make a decision]-->E[Defend decision];
      E[Defend decision]-->F[Receive feedback];
```
