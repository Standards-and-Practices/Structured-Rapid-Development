# Decision Case

Helping learners step into the shoes of a decision maker during a critical moment of decision can be an engaging way to teach both subject-matter and critical thinking. Decision-based cases are the most common type of case study.

# Pattern Structure

A learning experience implementing the Decision Case pattern typically follows the structure:

1. Explore a case
2. Identify options
3. Explore options
4. Make a decision
5. Defend decision
6. Receive feedback

## 1. Explore a case

- [Read A Case Study]()
- [Watch A Video Case Study]()
- [Listen To A Case Study]()
- [Engage In An Interactive Case Study]()

## 2. Idenfity options

- What is the decision that needs to be made in the case?
- What are the major decision options?
- [Brainstorming](/activities/activities/Brainstorming.md)

## 3. Explore options

- What questions will help you decide which decision option is best for you?
- What concepts and frameworks might help answer your questions?
- [Six Thinking Hats](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/the-six-thinking-hats)
- [Affinity Diagramming](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/affinity-map)
- [Rapid Research](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/rapid-research)

## 4. Make a decision

- What decision do you recommend?
- What are the major reasons that support your recommendation?
- What are the major risks of your recommended decision?

- [Decision Matrix](../../activities/EisenhowerDecisionMatrix.md)
- [How Now Wow](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/how-now-wow-matrix)
- [Pareto Chart](https://www.sessionlab.com/methods/pareto-chart)
- Scenario Planning

## 5. Defend decision

- Arrange the criteria in order of importance, from the most to least. The evidence should show how each criterion supports your recommended decision.
- Identify the high-level goals for your action plan. In other words, how do you want the action plan to change the situation in the case?
- Organize your action plan steps.
  - Short term
  - Long term
  - Major risks: Identify the most important one or two risks with your action plan.
  - Mitigation of risks: How would you eliminate or reduce the risks?
