# Cases

"Cases are an analogue of reality—an avatar, if you like—for the direct experience of business
or other types of activities. They immerse you in certainties and vagaries. To perform this
function, a case must have four characteristics:

- A significant business issue or issues
- Sufficient information on which to base conclusions about the issues
- No objective conclusion—in other words, no explicit or implied right answer
- A nonlinear organization"[^1]

"There are thousands of published cases, and each is, in a sense, unique. No case presents the same set of facts as any other case. But cases also have similarities that can facilitate your study of them. Most cases illustrate one of three core scenarios: 

- The need to make a [critical decision](./DecisionCase.md) and potentially persuade other characters in the case to accept it
- The need to perform an in-depth [evaluation](./EvaluationCase.md) that lays out the pros and cons or strengths and weaknesses of the subject of the case
- The need to perform a comprehensive [problem diagnosis](./ProblemDiagnosisCase.md) that identifies the root causes of a problem described in the case"[^1]
