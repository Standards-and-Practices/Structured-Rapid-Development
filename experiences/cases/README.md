# Cases

Case Studies can provide a memorable way to explore the "complexity and uniqueness of a particular project, policy, institution, program or system in a 'real life' context" (Simons, 2009, p. 21). While scientific experiments seek to identify causal links between an isolated variable and a particular phenomenon, case studies look at a single instance of something in its detail-rich context. 
 
At their essence, cases have two parts:
1. A set of facts, usually presented in narrative form as a story
2. A framework, used to interpret and make sense of the facts

Case studies help students to construct mental models that are applied to the facts. One of the most popular kinds of case studies is the Illustrative Case. This template provides a starting place for creating a Competency Achievement or OEX Section that follows the best practices for Illustrative Cases. 

"Cases are an analogue of reality—an avatar, if you like—for the direct experience of business or other types of activities. They immerse you in certainties and vagaries. To perform this function, a case must have four characteristics:

- A significant business issue or issues
- Sufficient information on which to base conclusions about the issues
- No objective conclusion—in other words, no explicit or implied right answer
- A nonlinear organization"[^1]

"There are thousands of published cases, and each is, in a sense, unique. No case presents the same set of facts as any other case. But cases also have similarities that can facilitate your study of them. Most cases illustrate one of three core scenarios: 

- The need to make a [critical decision](./DecisionCase.md) and potentially persuade other characters in the case to accept it
- The need to perform an in-depth [evaluation](./EvaluationCase.md) that lays out the pros and cons or strengths and weaknesses of the subject of the case
- The need to perform a comprehensive [problem diagnosis](./ProblemDiagnosisCase.md) that identifies the root causes of a problem described in the case"[^1]
