# Practice-based CBE Patterns
Practice is one of the most effective skill-building strategies for learners of all abilities. Well-designed opportunities for practice encourage proficient, accurate, and reliable demonstration of skills. Practice helps learners master foundational skills and build toward higher order thinking and application of learning in varied contexts.

But poorly designed practice opportunities can have detrimental effects by promoting rote memorization, reinforcing narrow skill development, and frustrating under-performing learners.
