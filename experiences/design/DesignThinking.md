# Design Thinking

Design thinking is a human-centric, iterative problem-solving method. While there are multiple frameworks for thinking about design, each shares some common principles.

- [Stanford D.School's Human-Centered Design Process](https://dschool.stanford.edu) - Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test
- [IDEO](https://www.ideou.com/blogs/inspiration/what-is-design-thinking) - inspiration, ideation, and implementation

## Pattern Structure

A learning experience implementing the Design Thinking pattern typically follows the structure:

<details open="open">
<summary>Quick Links</summary>

- [Empathize](#empathize) - Understand the user's deep needs.
- [Define](#define) - Decide what problem to solve.
- [Ideate](#ideate) - Generate ideas for solutions.
- [Prototype](#prototype) - Create a simple version of an idea to test.
- [Test](#test) - Learn from users using the prototype.

</details>

## Empathize

The first step in design thinking is to help learners develop empathy for their users.
