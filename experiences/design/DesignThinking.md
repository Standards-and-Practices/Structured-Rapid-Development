# Design Thinking
Design thinking is a human-centric, iterative problem-solving method. While there are multiple frameworks for thinking about design, each shares some common principles.

# Pattern Structure

A learning experience implementing the Design Thinking pattern typically follows the structure:

```mermaid
  flowchart LR;
      Empathize-->Define;
      Define-->Ideate;
      Ideate-->Prototype;
      Prototype-->Test;
```

- [Empathize](#empathize) - Understand the user's deep needs.
- [Define](#define) - Decide what problem to solve.
- [Ideate](#ideate) - Generate ideas for solutions.
- [Prototype](#prototype) - Create a simple version of an idea to test.
- [Test](#test) - Learn from users using the prototype.

## Empathize
The first step in design thinking is to help learners develop empathy for their users.
