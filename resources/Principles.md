# Guiding Principles
- [Understanding By Design (Backwards Design)](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/#stages)
- [Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) - Use patterns if available rather than recreating elements from scratch. 
- Community production - Anyone can submit a new pattern for inclusion in the collection. 
- Peer review to use, change and share patterns and templates
