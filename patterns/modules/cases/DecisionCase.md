# Structure of a Decision Case
A learning experience implementing the Decision Case pattern typically follows the structure:

|[1. Read a case](#read-a-case)|[2. Identify options](#idenfity-options)|[3. Explore options](#explore-options)|[4. Make a decision](#make-a-decision)|[5. Defend decision](#defend-decision)|[6. Receive feedback](#receive-feedback)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Learners take the role of the case's protagonist in a crucial moment. The decision might be identified for the student or might left implicit. The curriculum should lead the learner through an appropriate analysis to make and defend a decision. There isn't one best way to present a Decision Case. We have currated a few different way of arranging xBlocks for each part of a Decision Case.

## 1. Read a case

## 2. Idenfity options

## 3. Explore options

## 4. Make a decision

## 5. Defend decision

## 6. Receive feedback
