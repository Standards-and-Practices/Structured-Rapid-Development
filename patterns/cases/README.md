# Case Study Patterns

"Cases are an analogue of reality—an avatar, if you like—for the direct experience of business
or other types of activities. They immerse you in certainties and vagaries. To perform this
function, a case must have four characteristics:

- A significant business issue or issues
- Sufficient information on which to base conclusions about the issues
- No objective conclusion—in other words, no explicit or implied right answer
- A nonlinear organization"[^1]
