# Pathway Patterns
Pathways are organized sets of achievements that usually lead to some sort of credential (e.g. a degree, a certificate). There are several typical patterns that pathways take. 
- [Explorer](./pathways/Explorer.md) - Expose learners to a variety of topics.
- [Deep Dive](./pathways/DeepDive.md) - Increase a learner's proficiency in a single domain.

# Component Patterns
Modules are the sub-components of pathways. They could be found at the certificate, course, competency, or sub-competency level.
