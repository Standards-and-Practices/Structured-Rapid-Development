# Structured Rapid Development

At WGU, we work to be the world's most innovative, student-centric university. We combine insights from learning science with a seamless and delightful user experience to produce life-changing digital learning experiences for our learners.

Structured Rapid Development (SRD) involves using replicable patterns and templates throughout the product design and development process to structure and expedite it. Here, patterns means a way of configuring elements of a learning product into a viable learning pathway. Templates refer to an arrangement of specific xBlocks on a page.
