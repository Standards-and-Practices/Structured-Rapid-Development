# Market Sizing

A market sizing is an estimation of the total revenue opportunity in a defined market. It's a crucial tool for any business, as it allows you to make informed decisions about where to allocate resources.

There are a few different methods you can use to size a market, but the most common is to look at historical sales data. This can be for your own company, or for a competitor. If you're looking at a competitor, be sure to adjust for their market share.

Once you have this data, you can start to segment the market. This can be done by geography, industry, company size, or any other criteria that makes sense for your business. Once you have a good understanding of the different segments, you can start to estimate the total revenue opportunity.

This is where your assumptions come in. You'll need to make some assumptions about things like growth rates, market share, and so on. But as long as you're clear about your assumptions, you can make a very informed guess about the size of the market.

Once you have a market size, you can start to think about how to grow your business. Do you need to enter new markets? Do you need to launch new products? Do you need to improve your sales and marketing efforts? All of these decisions can be informed by a market sizing.

So why is a market sizing so important? Because it gives you a clear view of the opportunity in front of you. It helps you focus your resources on the areas that will have the biggest impact. And it gives you a framework for making decisions about how to grow your business.

If you're not already doing market sizing, I highly encourage you to start. It's a valuable exercise for any business, and it can help you make informed decisions about where to allocate your resources.
