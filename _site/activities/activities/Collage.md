# Collage

A collage is a piece of art made from smaller pieces of paper or other materials. To make a collage, you can glue or tape the pieces of paper onto a larger piece of paper or canvas. Collages can be made from all sorts of materials, including magazine cut-outs, wrappers, fabric, buttons, and more. You can use a collage to tell a story, express an idea, or just create a pretty picture. Collages are a great way to recycle materials that you would otherwise throw away. And, they can be a lot of fun to make!
