# Questionstorming

Questionstorming is a brainstorming technique in which you focus on generating questions, rather than answers. It's a powerful tool for uncovering new ideas and insights, and can be used in business, personal, and academic contexts. To make a Questionstorm, simply write down a prompt or topic in the center of a piece of paper, and then set a timer for two minutes. For the duration of the timer, write down as many questions as you can think of related to the prompt. Don't worry about whether or not the questions make sense, just keep the ideas flowing. Once the timer is up, take a break and then come back to the questions. Review them and circle the ones that are most interesting or provocative. These are the questions you should explore further. Questionstorming is useful because it helps you to think creatively and critically about a topic. It's a great way to generate new ideas, and can also help you to clarify your thinking on a subject.
