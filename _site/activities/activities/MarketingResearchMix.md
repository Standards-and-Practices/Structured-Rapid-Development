# Marketing Research Mix

A Marketing Research Mix is a tool used by marketing researchers to help determine the most appropriate research method(s) to use for a given project. It is also sometimes referred to as a research design matrix.

The first step in making a Marketing Research Mix is to list all of the possible research methods that could be used to answer the research question(s). Once all of the possible methods have been listed, the researcher then needs to evaluate each method based on a number of factors, including:

- The type of data that would be collected (quantitative, qualitative, or both)
- The cost of the method
- The time required to implement the method
- The resources required to implement the method
- The feasibility of implementing the method

After the evaluation of each method has been completed, the researcher can then choose the most appropriate research methods to use for the project. The Marketing Research Mix can be a useful tool for researchers as it helps to ensure that the most appropriate research methods are being used for a given project.
