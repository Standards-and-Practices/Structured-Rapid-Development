# Hook Model of Behavior Design

In his book, "The Lean Startup," Eric Ries talks about the importance of starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). He argues that startups should focus on building something small and simple that can be quickly and easily put in front of potential customers to get feedback. This feedback can then be used to make the product better.

The Hook Model of Behavior Design is a framework that takes Ries's MVP approach and applies it to user behavior. Instead of starting with a product, you start with a behavior. The goal is to get users to perform a desired action (the "hook") and then keep them coming back for more.

The Hook Model has four parts:

Trigger: The trigger is what initiates the behavior. It can be something internal (like a cue from your environment) or external (like a push notification).

Action: The action is the desired behavior. It should be something simple and easy to do.

Variable Reward: The reward is what comes after the action is taken. It should be something that is not always the same, otherwise the user will get bored. This could be something like a new piece of content, a game, or a coupon.

Investment: The investment is what the user puts into the system. It could be something like providing data, completing a profile, or connecting with friends. This increases the likelihood that the user will come back.

The Hook Model is a useful tool for behavior designers because it helps them identify the key ingredients for getting users to perform a desired action. By starting with a behavior instead of a product, designers can better understand how to create an engaging and addictive experience.
