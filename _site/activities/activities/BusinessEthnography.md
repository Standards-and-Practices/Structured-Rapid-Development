# Business Ethnography

A business ethnography is a type of research that uses anthropological methods to study the culture of a particular organization. This research is used to understand how employees interact with each other, how they make decisions, and how they understand and respond to changes in the workplace.

A business ethnography can be used to study any type of organization, from a small business to a multinational corporation. To make a business ethnography, researchers typically spend time observing employees in their natural work environment. They may also interview employees, review company documents, and participate in company activities.

Business ethnography is useful because it provides a detailed, inside look at how a company operates. This type of research can help organizations identify problems and find solutions that would be difficult to find using other methods.
