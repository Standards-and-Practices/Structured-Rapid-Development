# Business Motivation Model

Most people are familiar with the concept of a goal, and how setting and achieving goals is essential to success in any endeavor. What people may not be familiar with is how to create an effective goal, or how to create a system to track progress towards that goal. This is where the Business Motivation Model comes in.

The Business Motivation Model (BMM) is a framework for thinking about and planning business goals. It can be used to create both simple and complex goals, and to track progress towards those goals. The model is based on the idea that all businesses have four core elements: purpose, users, process, and data.

The first step in creating a BMM is to identify the purpose of the business. What is the business trying to achieve? This purpose should be something that can be measured, so that progress towards it can be tracked.

Next, the users of the business must be identified. Who will be using the product or service? What needs do they have that the business can meet?

After the users have been identified, the processes of the business must be mapped out. What steps need to be taken in order to achieve the business goals? What resources will be needed?

Finally, the data associated with the business must be gathered and analyzed. What metrics can be used to track progress towards the goals? What trends can be observed in the data?

The Business Motivation Model is a flexible framework that can be used to create and track progress towards any business goal. By taking the time to think about the purpose, users, process, and data associated with a business, it is possible to create a system that will help ensure success.
