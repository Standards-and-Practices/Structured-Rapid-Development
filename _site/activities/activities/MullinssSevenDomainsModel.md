# Mullins's Seven Domains Model

A Mullins's Seven Domains Model is a tool that can be used to help understand, analyze, and improve upon complex systems. It is a means of breaking down a system into seven different domains in order to more easily identify trouble spots and areas of improvement. The seven domains are:

1. Function
2. Behavior
3. Structure
4. Platform
5. Execution
6. Documentation
7. Environment

To create a Mullins's Seven Domains Model, first identify the complex system that you wish to analyze. Once you have done that, begin breaking the system down into its component parts, and understand how those parts interact with each other. Once you have a good understanding of the system, begin mapping out each of the seven domains. Include relevant information for each domain, such as key functions, behaviors, structures, platforms, etc.

Once you have completed your Mullins's Seven Domains Model, take a step back and examine it as a whole. Identify any areas that are lacking or could be improved upon. This process can be repeated as often as necessary to continue improving the system.

The Mullins's Seven Domains Model is a powerful tool that can be used to improve complex systems. By breaking a system down into seven different domains, it is easier to identify trouble spots and areas of improvement. Additionally, the model can be reused and modified as needed to continue improving the system.
