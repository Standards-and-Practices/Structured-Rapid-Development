# Card Sorting

Card sorting is a usability method used to help design or redesign websites. It is a simple, effective way to understand how your users think about the content and navigation on your site. To do a card sort, you need a group of participants and a list of topics or tasks (written on cards). The participants then sort the cards into groups that make sense to them. They can also name the groups. After the card sort, you will have a good understanding of how participants think about the tasks and content on your site. This will help you design a more user-friendly website.
