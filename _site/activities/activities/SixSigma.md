# Six Sigma

Six Sigma is a quality control methodology developed in 1986 by Motorola. The methodology includes a number of quality improvement tools, including Statistical Process Control, Design of Experiments and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis. Six Sigma is now used in a variety of industries, from manufacturing to healthcare.

There are a few steps involved in making a Six Sigma:

1. Define the problem or process you want to improve.
2. Measure the current performance of the process.
3. Analyze the data to identify potential causes of poor performance.
4. Improve the process by implementing solutions to address the root causes identified in the previous step.
5. Control the process to prevent future problems.

Why is Six Sigma useful? Six Sigma is useful because it can help organizations to improve the quality of their products and services. Additionally, it can help to reduce costs by reducing the number of defects in a process.
