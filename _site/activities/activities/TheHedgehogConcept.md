# The Hedgehog Concept

The Hedgehog Concept is a tool for businesses to use to help them focus on their core competencies. It's a way of thinking about what a business does best and then finding ways to do more of that.

The concept is named after the hedgehog, which is a small animal that is very good at one thing: surviving in the cold. The hedgehog doesn't try to do too many things; it just hunkers down and uses its one skill to stay alive.

In the same way, businesses need to focus on their one core competency and find ways to do more of what they do best. This doesn't mean that businesses shouldn't try new things, but they need to be careful not to spread themselves too thin.

There are three questions businesses need to ask themselves to create a Hedgehog Concept:

1. What can we be the best in the world at?
2. What drives our economic engine?
3. What are we passionate about?

Answering these questions can help businesses focus on their one core competency and find ways to do more of what they do best.
