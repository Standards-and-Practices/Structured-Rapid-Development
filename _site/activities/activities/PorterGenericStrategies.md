# Porter's Generic Competitive Strategies

Porter's Generic Competitive Strategies is a framework that organizations can use to develop strategies for gaining a competitive edge in their respective markets. The framework is based on the premise that there are three main ways to achieve this: 1. Cost Leadership: This involves creating a cost advantage over your competitors by being more efficient and vertically integrating where possible. 2. Differentiation: This involves creating a unique value proposition that sets you apart from your competitors and appeals to a specific target market. 3. Focus: This involves focusing on a specific niche market and customizing your offering to meet the needs of that market. To make a Porter's Generic Competitive Strategy, you need to first identify your organization's strengths and weaknesses. Once you have done this, you can then decide which of the three strategies would be most appropriate for your organization to pursue. Why is a Porter's Generic Competitive Strategy useful? It is useful because it provides a framework for thinking about how to create a competitive advantage. It forces you to think about your strengths and weaknesses and how you can use them to your advantage. Additionally, it makes you consider your target market and how you can best serve them.
