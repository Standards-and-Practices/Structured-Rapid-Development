# Yes And... (improv comedy)

In improv comedy, the performers create scenes based on suggestions from the audience. The scenes are usually funny, but they can also be serious or sentimental. The most important rule of improv is "Yes And…", which means that the performers must agree with each other and build on each other's ideas. This rule is what makes improv scenes work. Without it, the scenes would be confusing and would quickly fall apart.

Here's a quick guide to making a Yes And… improv scene:

1. One player starts by making a suggestion. For example, "Let's pretend we're in a restaurant."
2. The second player agrees with the suggestion and adds something. For example, "Yes, and I'm the waiter."
3. The scene continues with the players taking turns making suggestions and agreeing with each other.
4. If a player disagrees with a suggestion, they can say "No, but…" and offer a new suggestion. For example, "No, but let's pretend we're in a bank."

The Yes And… rule is the most important part of improv, but it's also useful in other areas of life. It can help you reach agreements with others, come up with new ideas, and build rapport. So next time you're in a meeting or discussion, try using the Yes And… rule and see where it takes you!
