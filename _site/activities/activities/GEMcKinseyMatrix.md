# GE-McKinsey Matrix

A GE-McKinsey matrix is a tool used by businesses to help them make decisions about where to allocate their resources. The matrix is named after its creators, General Electric and consulting firm McKinsey & Company.

The matrix is essentially a nine-box grid that can be used to help businesses evaluate opportunities and make decisions about where to invest their resources. The matrix looks at three factors:

- Market attractiveness: This considers the size and growth of the market, as well as the degree of competition.
- Industry attractiveness: This looks at the profitability of the industry and the barriers to entry.
- Company strength: This looks at the company's competitive advantage and its financial position.

Each of these factors is given a score, and the scores are used to plot where each opportunity falls on the matrix.

The matrix is a useful tool because it forces businesses to consider both the attractiveness of an opportunity and the company's ability to take advantage of that opportunity. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of a new opportunity and forget to consider whether the company has the resources to make the most of it.

The matrix can also help businesses prioritize their opportunities. If a company has a limited amount of resources, it can use the matrix to identify which opportunities are the most attractive and which ones it is best positioned to take advantage of.

Making a GE-McKinsey matrix is relatively simple. First, you need to score each opportunity on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of the three factors. Then you plot these scores on the matrix, with market attractiveness on the x-axis and company strength on the y-axis.

Once you have plotted all of your opportunities, you can start to identify which ones are the most attractive and which ones your company is best positioned to take advantage of.

The GE-McKinsey matrix is a valuable tool for any business that is looking to make decisions about where to allocate its resources. By considering both the attractiveness of an opportunity and the company's ability to take advantage of it, the matrix can help businesses prioritize their opportunities and make the most of their resources.
