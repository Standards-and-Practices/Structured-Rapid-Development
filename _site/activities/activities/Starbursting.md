What is a Starburst?

A Starburst is an powerful way to increase the speed, clarity and productivity of meetings and other group activities. It is a tool for structuring group discussion to ensure that all voices are heard and that ideas are thoroughly explored.

How to Make a Starburst

To make a Starburst, divide a large sheet of paper into four equal quadrants. Then, invite members of the group to each choose one quadrant and come up with three questions related to the topic under discussion. Once all the questions have been collected, have the group choose one question from each quadrant and answer them as a group.

Why Use a Starburst?

The Starbursting technique is beneficial because it forces groups to explore a topic from different angles. This process generates a diversity of perspectives and can lead to innovative solutions. Additionally, all group members are given an opportunity to contribute to the discussion, which can help build team morale.
