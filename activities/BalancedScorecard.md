# The Balanced Scorecard

# Getting Started

The Balanced Scorecard is a performance management tool that helps organizations to track and improve their performance. It does this by providing a comprehensive view of an organization's performance, using both financial and non-financial measures. The Balanced Scorecard is composed of four main quadrants: - Financial measures - Customer measures - Internal business process measures - Learning and growth measures Organizations can use the Balanced Scorecard to track their progress over time and identify areas where they need to improve. Additionally, the Balanced Scorecard can be used to develop annual performance goals and objectives. To create a Balanced Scorecard, organizations first need to identify the measures that are most important to their success. Once these measures have been identified, they can be categorized into the four quadrants of the Balanced Scorecard. Once the measures have been determined, organizations need to establish target values for each measure. These target values should be challenging but achievable. The Balanced Scorecard is a powerful tool that can help organizations to improve their performance. However, it is important to remember that the Scorecard is only as effective as the measures that are included in it. Therefore, organizations need to carefully select the measures that are most important to their success.
