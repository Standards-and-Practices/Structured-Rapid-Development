# The Resource-based Theory of the Firm

# Getting Started

A resource-based theory of the firm (RBT) is a model that views a company as a collection of assets and capabilities that give it a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The RBT model has its roots in economics, specifically in the work of Swiss economist Jean-Baptiste Say. In Say's law of markets, he argued that supply creates its own demand, and that firms produce goods and services in order to sell them. Today, the resource-based theory of the firm is used to explain why some companies are more successful than others. It is also used as a guide for managers, who can use the RBT model to identify a company's strengths and weaknesses and to make strategic decisions about where to allocate resources. The resource-based theory of the firm has been criticized for being too simplistic and for ignoring the role of luck in a company's success. However, it remains a popular and influential framework for understanding how firms compete and how they can create and sustain a competitive advantage.
