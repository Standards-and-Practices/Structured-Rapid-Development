# Listening Sessions

# Getting Started


A Listening Session is a great way to get feedback about your music from other people. It can be helpful to set up a Listening Session before you release your music, so you can get an idea of what people think of it.

To set up a Listening Session, find a few friends or family members who are willing to listen to your music and give you feedback. Make sure to choose people who you trust to be honest with you. Then, give them each a copy of your music and ask them to listen to it and take notes.

After they've had a chance to listen, meet up with them and ask them what they thought. Be open to hearing constructive criticism and use it to improve your music. You can also ask them what they liked about the music, so you can do more of that in future songs.

Listening Sessions can be really helpful in making your music the best it can be. They're also a great way to get to know your audience and what they're looking for in your music.
