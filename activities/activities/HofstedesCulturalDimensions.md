# Hofstede's cultural dimensions

# Getting Started

If you're familiar with the work of Geert Hofstede, then you know that he's best known for his research on cross-cultural differences. In particular, he's famous for his work on what he calls "cultural dimensions." Basically, a Hofstede's cultural dimension is a framework that you can use to understand how different cultures view the world. There are six dimensions in total, but the four that are most relevant to business are: 1) Individualism vs. Collectivism 2) Power Distance 3) Uncertainty Avoidance 4) Masculinity vs. Femininity You can use Hofstede's cultural dimensions to better understand how people in different cultures think and behave. This, in turn, can help you to improve communication and collaboration between people from different cultures. To create your own Hofstede's cultural dimension, simply choose one of the four dimensions listed above and rate it on a scale of 1 to 7. 1 indicates that the culture is not very pronounced on that dimension, while 7 indicates that the culture is very pronounced on that dimension. For example, if you were to rate the United States on the individualism vs. collectivism dimension, you might give it a 4 or 5. This is because individualism is fairly valued in the U.S., but it's not the most important thing. In contrast, if you were to rate Japan on the same dimension, you might give it a 1 or 2. This is because collectivism is much more important in Japan than individualism. Once you've rated a culture on all four dimensions, you'll have a good understanding of that culture's overall outlook on the world. This can be extremely useful when working with people from that culture, as it will help you to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunication.
