# Drivers of trust and the Trust Cycle

# Getting Started

A Driver of trust is a reliable method by which an organization can ensure that its employees are trustworthy. The Trust Cycle is a reliable way to create and maintain trust between an organization and its employees. It is based on the idea that trust is built up over time through positive interactions and experiences. The Trust Cycle has four stages: 

**Stage 1:** Pre-trust This stage is characterized by mistrust and suspicion. Employees are likely to be skeptical of management and may not be willing to trust them. 

**Stage 2:** Building trust In this stage, employees begin to trust management more and are willing to cooperate with them. This trust is usually built through positive experiences, such as feeling supported and recognized for good work. 

**Stage 3:** Consolidating trust At this stage, trust has been established and employees are more likely to give their best to the organization. This trust enables employees to feel comfortable taking risks and challenging themselves. 

**Stage 4:** Post-trust This stage is characterized by a deep sense of trust between employees and management. Employees feel that they can be themselves and are able to openly give their feedback. 

This trust allows for greater creativity and innovation.
