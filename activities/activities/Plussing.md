# Plussing

A Plussing is an brainstorming technique that can be used to generate new ideas. To make a Plussing, you take an existing idea and add something to it to make it better. This can be done by adding a new feature, removing a disadvantage, or improving upon an existing aspect. Plussings are useful because they help you to think creatively and come up with new ideas that you may not have thought of otherwise.

For example, let's say you're trying to come up with a new feature for your website. One way to do this is to take an existing feature and add something to it. For instance, you could add a new button that allows users to share your content on social media. Or, you could add a new section that displays related content.

You can also use Plussing to remove a disadvantage. For example, let's say your website is hard to navigate. One way to Pluss this is to add a new navigation bar that is easy to use. Or, you could add a search bar so that users can easily find what they're looking for.

Finally, you can also use Plussing to improve upon an existing aspect. For example, let's say your website is not very user-friendly. One way to Pluss this is to add a new tutorial that walks users through the basics of using your site. Or, you could add a live chat feature so that users can get help from you if they're having trouble.

Plussing is a great brainstorming technique that can help you to come up with new ideas. By taking an existing idea and adding something to it, you can come up with something that is even better. So next time you're stuck for ideas, try using Plussing to come up with something new and improved.
