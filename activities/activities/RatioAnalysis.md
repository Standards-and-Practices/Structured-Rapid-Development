# Ratio Analysis

# Getting Started

A ratio is a mathematical comparison of two values. It is used to measure efficiency, performance, and liquidity. A Ratio Analysis is used to create a financial snapshot of a company. It compares line items in the financial statements to identify trends. This analysis can be used to make strategic decisions about a company. To create a Ratio Analysis, first, find the desired ratios from the financial statements. Next, create a table with the ratios and the year over year changes. Then, analyze the data and identify any trends. Ratio Analysis is a valuable tool for decision making. It can help identify inefficiencies and areas of improvement. It can also help compare a company to its competitors.
