# GROW Coaching Model

A GROW Coaching Model is a simple framework that can be used to coach individuals or teams. It's a great way to help people identify and achieve their goals, and it's also a great tool for team building. 

GROW stands for
- **G**oal
- **R**eality
- **O**ptions
- **W**ay Forward

To use the GROW coaching model, all you need is a whiteboard or piece of paper and a pen. Draw a quadrant on the whiteboard or fold the paper in half vertically and horizontally then open it to form four equal squares and answer the following questions. 

| Goal<br>What do you want to achieve? | Reality<br/>Where are you now? | 
| --- | --- |
| Options<br/>What could you do? | Way Forward<br/>What will you do? |


Once they have brainstormed their strategies, encourage them to choose one or two and get started on implementing them.
