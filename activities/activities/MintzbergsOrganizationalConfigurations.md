# Mintzberg's Organizational Configurations

Most organizations can be classified into one of Henry Mintzberg's five types of organizational structure. Mintzberg's five organizational types are machine bureaucracy, divisional form, professional bureaucracy, simple structure, and adhocracy. Each type of organization has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Machine bureaucracy is the most efficient and formal of all the structures. In this type of organization, everything is very structured and there is a clear chain of command. One disadvantage of this type of organization is that it can be inflexible and slow to respond to change.

The divisional form is similar to machine bureaucracy, but is organized around products, services, or geographic regions. This type of organization can be very efficient, but it can also lead to duplication of effort and a lack of cooperation between divisions.

Professional bureaucracy is a type of organization that is common in the public sector and in professions such as medicine and law. In this type of organization, there is a clear hierarchy, but decisions are made by professional experts rather than by managers. This type of organization can be efficient, but it can also be inflexible.

The simple structure is the least formal of all the organizational types. This type of organization is often used in start-ups and small businesses. In a simple structure, there is a clear chain of command, but there is also a lot of flexibility.

Adhocracy is the most flexible of all the organizational types. This type of organization is often used in research and development. In an adhocracy, there is no formal structure. Instead, decisions are made by a team of experts. The advantage of this type of organization is that it is very flexible and can respond quickly to change. The disadvantage is that it can be chaotic and may not be very efficient.
