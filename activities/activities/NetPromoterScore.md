# Net Promoter Score



If you’re not familiar with Net Promoter Scores, or NPS, they’re a customer satisfaction metric that measures how likely your customers are to recommend your product or service to others. NPS is calculated by taking the percentage of customers who are Promoters and subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors. 

In order to calculate your company’s NPS, you’ll need to survey your customers and ask them how likely they are to recommend your product or service on a scale of 0 to 10. Promoters are customers who respond with a score of 9-10, Detractors are customers who respond with a score of 0-6, and Passives are customers who respond with a score of 7-8. 

Once you have the results of your customer survey, calculating your NPS is a simple matter of subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters. For example, if you had 100 customers and 30% were Promoters, 20% were Passives, and 50% were Detractors, your NPS would be: 

NPS = 30% - 50% = -20

As you can see, NPS can be a negative number, which means you have more Detractors than Promoters. While a negative NPS isn’t ideal, it’s still possible to have a successful business. In fact, many companies with very high NPS scores still have plenty of room for improvement. 

NPS is a valuable metric because it allows you to track customer satisfaction over time and make changes to your product or service accordingly. Additionally, NPS can help you identify your company’s biggest fans and evangelists, who can be extremely valuable in promoting your business to others. 

If you’re not already tracking your company’s NPS, I highly recommend that you start doing so. It’s a quick and easy way to get valuable feedback from your customers, and it can help you make your business more successful in the long run.
