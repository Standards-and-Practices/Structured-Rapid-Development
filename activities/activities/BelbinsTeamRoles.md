# Belbin's Team Roles

# Getting Started

In 1981, Dr. Meredith Belbin defined a set of team roles that can help explain why some teams gel while others don't. Belbin's team roles are a model for understanding how people interact in groups and how those interactions contribute to the group's effectiveness. The model identifies nine different roles that people can take on in a group: 1. Plant: creative, generating new ideas 2. Resource Investigator: outgoing, curious, exploratory 3. Co-ordinator: takes charge, organises and delegates 4. Shaper: challenge the status quo, stir things up 5. Monitor Evaluator: takes a step back, analyses, offers objective criticism 6. Team Worker: good listener, builds bridges, harmonises 7. Implementer: pragmatic, gets things done, likes technique and process 8. Completer Finisher: attention to detail, sticks to deadlines, ensures quality 9. Specialist: expert in their field who can be relied on for detailed knowledge How to make a Belbin's Team Roles? 1. Plant: Find someone who is creative and good at generating new ideas. 2. Resource Investigator: Find someone who is outgoing, curious, and exploratory. 3. Co-ordinator: Find someone who takes charge, is organised, and can delegate effectively. 4. Shaper: Find someone who is willing to challenge the status quo and stir things up. 5. Monitor Evaluator: Find someone who takes a step back, analyses objectively, and offers criticism when necessary. 6. Team Worker: Find someone who is a good listener, builds bridges, and harmonises well with others. 7. Implementer: Find someone who is pragmatic, gets things done, and likes technique and process. 8. Completer Finisher: Find someone who pays attention to detail, sticks to deadlines, and ensures quality. 9. Specialist: Find someone who is an expert in their field and can be relied on for detailed knowledge. Why it's useful? Belbin's team roles are useful because they provide a framework for understanding how people interact in groups and how those interactions contribute to the group's effectiveness. By understanding the different roles that people can take on in a group, you can more effectively assess the strengths and weaknesses of your team and identify areas where the team could improve. Additionally, Belbin's team roles can help you determine what type of person would be a good fit for a certain position on your team.
