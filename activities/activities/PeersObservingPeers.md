# Peers Observing Peers

A Peers Observing Peers is simply two or more students observing and learning from each other. To make a Peers Observing Peers, simply put two students side-by-side and have them take turns observing and imitating what the other is doing. Why is this useful? Well, first of all, it's a great way for students to learn from each other. Secondly, it allows students to get a feel for what it's like to be in the shoes of someone else - to see the world from another perspective. Third, it builds cooperation and communication skills. Lastly, it's just plain fun!
