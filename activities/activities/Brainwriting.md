What is a Brainwriting?

A brainwriting is simply a written brainstorming technique that allows you to capture ideas from a group of people in a short period of time. It's an efficient way to generate ideas, and it's especially useful when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly.

How do you make a Brainwriting?

To make a brainwriting, you'll need a group of people and a timer. Each person will need a piece of paper and a pen. Set the timer for a short amount of time (5-10 minutes is usually plenty).

Then, each person should write down as many ideas as they can think of on their piece of paper. Once the timer goes off, everyone should stop writing and pass their paper to the person next to them.

The next person should read the ideas on the paper and then add any new ideas that come to mind. They should then pass the paper to the next person, and so on. Continue until everyone has had a chance to read and add to all of the papers.

Why is a Brainwriting useful?

Brainwritings are useful because they allow a group of people to quickly generate a large number of ideas. They're also useful because they force people to build on each other's ideas, which can lead to even more creative solutions.
