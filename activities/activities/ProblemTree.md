# Problem Tree

# Getting Started

A problem tree is a visual tool that helps you to identify the causes and consequences of a problem. It is a useful tool for problem solving because it can help you to see the relationships between different factors, and it can help you to identify the root cause of a problem. To make a problem tree, start by writing the problem at the top of a piece of paper. Then, draw a tree trunk underneath the problem, and write the different causes of the problem on the branches. Finally, draw the different consequences of the problem on the leaves of the tree. Problem trees are useful because they can help you to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts. By identifying the different causes and consequences of a problem, you can develop a more targeted solution. Additionally, problem trees can help you to identify the root cause of a problem, which is often the key to solving it.
