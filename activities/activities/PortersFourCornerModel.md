# Porter's Four Corner Model

Porter’s Four Corner Model is a powerful tool that can be used to analyze a company and its business environment. It is a framework that businesses can use to identify the key drivers of their business and to develop strategies to improve their performance.

The Four Corner Model is based on four key drivers of business performance:

1. Customer Power
2. Supplier Power
3. Competitive Rivalry
4. Threat of New Entrants

To create a Porter’s Four Corner Model, businesses need to first identify the key drivers of their business. They can then use this information to develop strategies to improve their performance.

Customer Power is the ability of customers to drive business strategy and performance. Businesses need to understand their customers’ needs and preferences in order to create value for them.

Supplier Power is the ability of suppliers to drive business strategy and performance. Businesses need to understand the bargaining power of their suppliers and how this can impact their cost structure.

Competitive Rivalry is the intensity of competition between businesses in an industry. Businesses need to understand the competitive landscape in order to develop strategies to stay ahead of the competition.

Threat of New Entrants is the likelihood of new businesses entering an industry. Businesses need to understand the barriers to entry in their industry in order to develop strategies to protect their market share.

The Porter’s Four Corner Model is a useful tool for businesses to use in order to identify the key drivers of their business and to develop strategies to improve their performance. By understanding these drivers, businesses can make better decisions about how to grow their business and create value for their customers.
