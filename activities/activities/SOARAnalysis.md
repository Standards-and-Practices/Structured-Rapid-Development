# SOAR Analysis

A SOAR analysis is a tool used to help organizations identify and assess opportunities and risks. It can be used to identify new markets, products, or services; assess the viability of new business models; or evaluate the potential impact of changes in the external environment.

SOAR analyses are based on the principles of SWOT analysis, but go beyond simply listing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. A SOAR analysis requires organizations to also identify theSource of the opportunities and risks, the Objective of pursuing them, the Actions necessary to take advantage of the opportunity or mitigate the risk, and the Results that will be achieved.

In other words, a SOAR analysis helps organizations not just identify opportunities and risks, but also develop a plan for how to capitalize on the former and mitigate the latter.

There are four steps to conducting a SOAR analysis:

1.Identify the organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

2.For each opportunity or risk, identify the source.

3.Determine the objective of pursuing or mitigating the opportunity or risk.

4.Develop a plan of action to take advantage of the opportunity or mitigate the risk, and identify the results that will be achieved.

A SOAR analysis can be a powerful tool for any organization, large or small. By taking the time to identify and assess opportunities and risks, and develop a plan for how to pursue or mitigate them, organizations can increase their chances of success.
