# EPRG Model

If you're in the marketing world, you've probably heard of the EPRG framework. Developed in the 1970s, the EPRG framework is a model that helps organizations determine which communication strategies to use when marketing to different countries. The model is based on the idea that countries can be classified into four different groups based on their levels of economic development and their cultural orientation.

The four groups are:

- **Ethnocentric**: This group includes countries that are highly industrialized and have a high level of economic development. The United States is an example of an ethnocentric country.

- **Polycentric**: This group includes countries that are less industrialized and have a lower level of economic development. An example of a polycentric country is Mexico.

- **Regiocentric**: This group includes countries that are in the same region but have different levels of economic development. An example of a regiocentric country is Canada.

- **Geocentric**: This group includes countries that are in different regions and have different levels of economic development. An example of a geocentric country is China.

The EPRG framework is a useful tool for organizations because it helps them to tailor their communication strategies to different countries. By understanding the different groups, organizations can better understand the needs of their customers and what messages will resonate with them.
