# How Might We Questions



A How Might We Question (HMW) is a type of question that is used to generate new ideas. It is typically used in the brainstorming process in order to come up with new and innovative solutions to problems. 

To make a HMW question, you simply need to take a problem or challenge that you are facing and add the words "How might we" to the beginning of it. For example, if you are trying to come up with a new product idea, your HMW question might be "How might we create a new product that is unique and different from anything else on the market?" 

HMW questions are useful because they force you to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions. They can also help to focus your brainstorming session by providing a specific problem to focus on.
