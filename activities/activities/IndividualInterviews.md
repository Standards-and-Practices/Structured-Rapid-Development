# Individual Interviews
Individual interviews are a key qualitative research method. They provide in-depth information about a respondentâ€™s views, opinions, and experiences. Individual interviews are conducted one-on-one, allowing for a more personal exchange than focus groups or other types of interviews. When conducting an individual interview, it is important to establish rapport with the respondent. This can be done by starting with some small talk, being genuine and interested in what they have to say, and making sure to create a comfortable environment. Once rapport is established, you can begin asking your prepared questions. Individual interviews are useful for exploring sensitive topics, as respondents may feel more comfortable talking about personal experiences one-on-one. They are also useful for exploring complex issues in depth. When conducting an individual interview, be sure to take detailed notes or record the conversation. This will help you to later recall what was said and better analyze the data.
