# Heron's Six Categories of Intervention
Most people have heard of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, which posits that people are motivated to meet basic needs like food and shelter before they can focus on higher needs like self-actualization. Heron's Six Categories of Intervention is a similar model, but it is specifically geared toward helping people in counseling or therapy. The six categories are: 1. Survival and safety 2. Basic needs 3. Belonging and love 4. Power and control 5. Freedom and self-expression 6. Fun and play Just as with Maslow's Hierarchy, the categories are hierarchical, with people needing to meet the lower-level needs before they can focus on the higher-level ones. However, unlike Maslow's Hierarchy, Heron's model is not static. People can move back and forth between the different levels as their needs change. So, how can you use Heron's Six Categories of Intervention in your counseling or therapy practice? When working with a client, you can use the model to identify what their primary need is and tailor your interventions accordingly. For example, if a client is struggling with addiction, they may be mostly focused on survival and safety in the early stages of treatment. As they progress, they may start to focus on other needs like belonging and love. The beauty of Heron's model is that it can be used with clients of all ages and backgrounds. It is also flexible, so you can adapt it to fit the needs of each individual client. If you're looking for a way to better understand your clients and tailor your interventions to their needs, Heron's Six Categories of Intervention is a great place to start.
