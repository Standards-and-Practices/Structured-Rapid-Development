Porter's Five Forces is a valuable tool for analyzing the competitive landscape of an industry. It can help you identify the key drivers of competition and develop strategies to stay ahead of the competition. 

The framework was developed by Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School. 



The five forces are: 
1. Threat of new entrants 
2. Threat of substitute products or services 
3. Bargaining power of suppliers 
4. Bargaining power of buyers 
5. Rivalry among existing competitors
