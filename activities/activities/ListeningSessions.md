# Design Listening Sessions

# Getting Started


Design Listening Sessions are a great way to get feedback from your target audience about your product or service. By hosting a listening session, you can gather valuable insights that you can use to improve your offering. Here's how to make a great listening session:

1. Choose your target audience. You'll want to select a group of people who are representative of your potential customer base.

2. Invite your target audience to participate. Make sure to let them know that their feedback is important to you.

3. Prepare your questions. You'll want to have a list of questions ready that will help you understand what your target audience likes and doesn't like about your product or service.

4. Hold the listening session. Make sure to give your target audience ample time to provide their feedback.

5. Use the feedback to improve your offering. Take the insights you've gathered and use them to make your product or service even better.
