# Mapping and Mitigating Risk

Maps are used to understand, manage and monitor risk. They help individuals and organizations to make decisions about where to allocate resources to reduce risk. Mitigating risk is about taking action to reduce the likelihood or impact of an adverse event. It is an important part of any risk management strategy. There are many different ways to create a map of risk. The most important part is to make sure that the map is relevant to the audience and the purpose. For example, a map of financial risk would be different than a map of safety risk. Once the map is created, it is important to identify the areas of high risk. These areas should be given special attention in the risk management strategy. Mitigating risk can take many different forms. It is often most effective when it is done proactively, before an adverse event occurs. Some common risk mitigation strategies include insurance, diversification, and hedging. insurance protects against loss in the event of an adverse event. diversification protects against loss by spreading assets across different types of investments. hedging protects against loss by taking action to offset the potential for loss. Risk mitigation is an important tool for managing risk. It can help to reduce the likelihood or impact of an adverse event. When used effectively, it can protect individuals and organizations from loss.
