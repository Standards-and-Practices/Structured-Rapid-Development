# Six Levels of Strategic Agility and Cost Control

# Getting Started

The Six Levels of Strategic Agility and Cost Control is a framework that can help organizations make decisions about where to allocate resources in order to achieve their desired outcomes. The framework is made up of six levels, each of which corresponds to a different degree of strategic agility and cost control. Organizations can use the Six Levels of Strategic Agility and Cost Control to determine which level of agility and cost control is right for them, and how to allocate resources accordingly. The framework can also be used to assess an organization's current state and identify areas for improvement. The six levels are: 1. Level One: Strategic Agility and Cost Control are not a priority. 2. Level Two: Strategic Agility and Cost Control are a priority, but the organization does not have a clear plan for how to achieve them. 3. Level Three: The organization has a clear plan for how to achieve Strategic Agility and Cost Control, but it is not being executed effectively. 4. Level Four: The organization is executing its plan for Strategic Agility and Cost Control effectively, but it is not continually adapting and improving. 5. Level Five: The organization is executing its plan for Strategic Agility and Cost Control effectively and continually adapting and improving. 6. Level Six: The organization has achieved Strategic Agility and Cost Control and is now sustaining them over the long term. The Six Levels of Strategic Agility and Cost Control can be used by organizations of any size and in any industry. They can be especially helpful for organizations that are undergoing rapid change or that are facing uncertain times.
