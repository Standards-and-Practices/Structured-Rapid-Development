# The Rule of 150

The Rule of 150 is a great way to make sure you're always meeting new people and networking.

Here's how it works:

1. Make a list of 150 people you know. These can be friends, family, co-workers, classmates, or anyone else you can think of.
2. Make sure you have their contact information (phone number, email, social media, etc.)
3. Once a week, reach out to one person on your list and catch up. This can be a quick phone call, coffee date, or even just a text message.
4. Repeat this process until you've contacted everyone on your list.

The Rule of 150 is a great way to build relationships and expand your network. By reaching out to one person each week, you'll soon have a strong network of people you can rely on.
