# Storyboard

If you're anything like me, you're a visual person. You like to see things laid out in front of you so you can get a sense of the overall picture. That's where storyboards come in. A storyboard is a visual representation of a sequence of events. It can be used for anything from planning a story to mapping out a website. To make a storyboard, all you need is a piece of paper and a pencil. Draw a line down the middle of the paper to create two columns. In the left column, write a brief description of each scene. In the right column, sketch a quick sketch of the scene. That's it! Once you have a storyboard, you can start to see the big picture. This is especially useful when you're planning something complex like a website. You can map out each page and how it flows into the next. Storyboards are also a great tool for brainstorming. If you're stuck on what to do next, try sketching out a few possible scenes. This can help you get unstuck and generate some new ideas. So, next time you're feeling stuck, grab a pencil and paper and give storyboarding a try!
