# McKinsey's Three Horizons of Growth



If your company is looking to grow, it's important to have a plan for how to best allocate resources to fuel that growth. That's where McKinsey's Three Horizons of Growth comes in.

What is McKinsey's Three Horizons of Growth?

Horizon 1 growth is all about your core business - the products or services that you're known for and that generate the most revenue. To continue growing, you need to invest in Horizon 1 and make sure it is running as efficiently as possible.

Horizon 2 growth comes from new initiatives - things that are adjacent to your core business and that have the potential to generate significant revenue. These are typically new products or services, or new markets that you can enter.

Horizon 3 growth is about transformational initiatives - these are risky bets that could pay off big time, but may not. These are the kinds of initiatives that have the potential to create entirely new businesses.

How to Create a McKinsey's Three Horizons of Growth

To create your own McKinsey's Three Horizons of Growth, start by looking at your company's current products, services, and markets.

For Horizon 1, identify the areas that generate the most revenue and are the most important to your company's success. For Horizon 2, look for new initiatives that could complement your core business. And for Horizon 3, identify transformational ideas that could create entirely new businesses.

Once you've identified the three horizons, it's important to allocate resources accordingly. The majority of your resources should go towards Horizon 1, as that is where you're most likely to see immediate results. However, you also need to invest in Horizon 2 and 3 initiatives to ensure long-term growth.

Why McKinsey's Three Horizons of Growth is Useful

The beauty of McKinsey's Three Horizons of Growth is that it forces you to think about growth in a holistic way. Too often, companies focus all of their energy on Horizon 1 initiatives, and while that can generate short-term growth, it's not sustainable in the long run.

By thinking about all three horizons, you can ensure that you're investing in growth initiatives that will pay off in the short-term, while also laying the groundwork for long-term success.
