# Nadler-Tushman Congruence Model

In any organization, there are always competing demands placed on employees. The Nadler-Tushman Congruence Model is a framework that can be used to help map out and understand these competing demands, and how they relate to each other.

The model consists of four key elements: inputs, outputs, tasks, and person-environment fit. Inputs are the resources that an individual brings to a task, including skills, knowledge, and experience. Outputs are the results of a task, which can be either tangible or intangible. Tasks are the specific actions that an individual must take to produce an output. And finally, person-environment fit is the compatibility between an individual and their work environment.

To create a Nadler-Tushman Congruence Model, start by identifying the inputs, outputs, and tasks for a specific job. Then, assess the person-environment fit for that job. Is the individual a good match for the job, based on their skills, knowledge, and experience? Or is the job environment itself conducive to the individual's success?

This model can be helpful in a number of ways. First, it can be used to identify areas of potential conflict within an organization. If two employees are competing for the same inputs or outputs, that can be a source of tension. Second, the model can help identify areas where an individual may be struggling. If an employee is having difficulty meeting the demands of their job, the model can help pinpoint where the problem lies. Finally, the model can help assess whether a job is a good fit for an individual. If an individual is constantly struggling to meet the demands of their job, it may be time to reassess whether that job is the right fit for them.
