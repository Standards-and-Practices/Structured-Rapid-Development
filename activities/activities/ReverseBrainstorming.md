# Reverse Brainstorming

Reverse brainstorming is a creative problem-solving technique that reverses the traditional brainstorming process. Instead of starting with a problem and asking how to solve it, reverse brainstorming starts with a desired goal and asks how to achieve it.

The first step in reverse brainstorming is to clearly identify the desired goal. Once the goal is identified, the group brainstorming the problem should ask themselves how they could achieve the opposite of the goal. For example, if the goal is to increase sales, the group would brainstorm ways to decrease sales. Once the group has brainstormed a list of ideas, they should then go through the list and identify which ideas could be used to achieve the desired goal.

Reverse brainstorming can be used in a variety of situations to help generate new ideas. It is especially useful when a group is having difficulty brainstorming ideas because it forces them to think outside the box. Additionally, reverse brainstorming can help groups avoid getting fixated on a single solution to a problem.

If you’re facing a problem and feel like you’ve brainstormed all the obvious solutions, give reverse brainstorming a try. It just might help you come up with a creative solution that you never would have thought of otherwise.
