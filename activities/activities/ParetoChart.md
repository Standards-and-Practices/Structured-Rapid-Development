# Pareto Chart

A Pareto chart is a graphical tool used to display the relative proportions of occurrence of different values. The values are typically displayed in descending order, with the highest values at the left and the lowest values at the right. The Pareto chart is named after Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist who observed in 1906 that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. Pareto charts can be used to display any kind of data, but they are most commonly used to display data that can be categorized. For example, a Pareto chart of customer complaints might show that 80% of the complaints are about 20% of the products. To make a Pareto chart, first decide what categories you want to use. Then, count the number of items in each category. Finally, plot the data on a graph, with the categories on the x-axis and the counts on the y-axis. Pareto charts are useful because they can help you identify which areas are responsible for the majority of a problem. For example, if you are trying to reduce the number of customer complaints, a Pareto chart can help you identify which products are responsible for the majority of the complaints. Once you know which areas are responsible for the problem, you can focus your efforts on those areas and achieve the biggest impact.
