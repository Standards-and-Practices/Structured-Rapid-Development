# Value-Based Management





Many companies shy away from Value-Based Management (VBM), because it can be difficult to define what represents value. Is it the amount of money a company makes? The quality of its products or services? The satisfaction of its customers? The engagement of its employees?

The answer is all of the above—and more. Value is whatever creates the most value for the company and its stakeholders.

Creating a VBM system can be complex, but it's worth the effort. VBM can help organizations make better decisions, allocate resources more efficiently, and improve performance.

There are four basic steps to creating a VBM system:

1. Define value. This step requires a deep understanding of the company's stakeholders and what they value most.

2. Measure value. Once you know what to measure, you need to choose the right metrics.

3. Create value. This step is all about execution. It's important to remember that value is not created in a vacuum—it requires the right mix of people, processes, and technology.

4. Communicate value. VBM is pointless if no one knows about it. Leaders need to communicate the system to everyone in the organization and make sure they understand how it works.

If done correctly, VBM can be a powerful tool for creating value. It can help organizations make better decisions, allocate resources more efficiently, and improve performance.
