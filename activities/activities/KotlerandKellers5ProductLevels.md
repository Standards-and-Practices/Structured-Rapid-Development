# Kotler and Keller's 5 Product Levels



Kotler and Keller's 5 Product Levels is a tool that businesses can use to create a clear and concise product strategy. It involves breaking down your product offering into five distinct levels, each with its own unique benefits and features. By doing this, you can more easily identify which products are most important to your customers and what needs to be done to make them successful.

The five levels are:

1. Core product: This is the basic need that your product satisfies. For example, a car's core product is transportation.

2. Basic product: This is the next level up from the core product and adds additional features and benefits that the customer desires. For example, a car's basic product might include features like air conditioning and power windows.

3. Expectation product: This is the level where your product meets the customer's expectations and provides them with what they expect from the product. For example, a car's expectation product might include features like a warranty and 24-hour roadside assistance.

4. Augmented product: This is the level where your product goes above and beyond the customer's expectations and provides them with additional features and benefits that they didn't even know they wanted. For example, a car's augmented product might include features like heated seats and a Navigation system.

5. Potential product: This is the level where your product has the potential to be even more than it is today. It is the highest level of the Kotler and Keller's 5 Product Levels and is the level that all businesses should strive for.
