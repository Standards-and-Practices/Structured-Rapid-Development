# OGSM Frameworks

An OGSM Framework is a framework that captures an organization's current state and defines its desired future state. It is a tool used by organizations to drive strategy and track progress.

A OGSM Framework typically has four components:

1. Objective - What is the organization trying to achieve?
2. Goal - What are the specific goals that need to be achieved to achieve the objective?
3. Strategy - What are the high-level actions that need to be taken to achieve the goals?
4. Metrics - How will progress be tracked?

A OGSM Framework can be created by first identifying the organization's objective. Once the objective is defined, specific goals need to be created that will help achieve the objective. Next, high-level strategies should be identified that will help achieve the goals. Finally, metrics should be selected that will be used to track progress towards the goals.

A OGSM Framework is useful because it provides a clear road map for an organization. It can be used to track progress and ensure that the organization is on track to achieve its objectives.
