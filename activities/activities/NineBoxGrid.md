# The Nine-Box Grid

The Nine-Box Grid is a tool used by HR professionals to help identify high-potential employees. It is based on the premise that there are nine key attributes that distinguish high-potential employees from their peers.

These attributes are:

1. Achievement orientation
2. Drive
3. Learning agility
4. Change tolerance
5. Self-confidence
6. Enthusiasm
7. Creativity
8. Cooperation
9. Persistence

To create a Nine-Box Grid, HR professionals simply plot each employee on a three-by-three grid, with the nine attributes listed above as the axes. High-potential employees will tend to cluster in the upper-right quadrant of the grid, while low-potential employees will tend to cluster in the lower-left quadrant. The Nine-Box Grid is useful because it provides a simple, visual way to identify high-potential employees. It is also relatively easy to construct and does not require a lot of data.
