# Little Bets by Peter Sims



In his book "Little Bets", Peter Sims talks about the importance of making small bets in order to succeed in business. He believes that by making small bets, you can learn what works and what doesn't, without risking too much. He gives the example of how Steve Jobs used this approach when developing the first Apple computer. Jobs made small bets along the way, learning from each one, until he finally created a product that was a success.

 Sims also talks about how to make a Little Bet. He says that the best Little Bets are those that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. He gives the example of a small business owner who wants to increase sales. A specific Little Bet in this case might be to offer a discount on a new product for one week. By doing this, the business owner can measure how many additional sales are made as a result of the discount, and determine whether or not it's an effective way to increase sales.

Making Little Bets is a great way to experiment and learn without risking too much. By making small bets, you can try out new ideas and see what works, without having to put all your eggs in one basket.
