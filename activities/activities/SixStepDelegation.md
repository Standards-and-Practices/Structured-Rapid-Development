# The Six Steps of Delegation

# Getting Started

The Six Steps of Delegation is a process that helps ensure that tasks are delegated effectively. It involves six steps: 1. Define the task. 2. Assign the task. 3. Set the expectations. 4. Transfer the knowledge. 5. Check in. 6. Follow up. This process helps to avoid common delegation pitfalls, such as not being clear about what needs to be done, or not setting adequate expectations. When done correctly, delegation can be an extremely effective tool for managing time and workloads.
