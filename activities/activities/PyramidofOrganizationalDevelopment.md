# Pyramid of Organizational Development



The term “pyramid of organizational development” was coined by Dr. Robert H. Beck in the early 1970s. It is a model that describes the levels of development that organizations go through as they grow and mature. The model has 5 levels:

1. Level 5 - Pre-contemplation
2. Level 4 - Contemplation
3. Level 3 - Preparation
4. Level 2 - Action
5. Level 1 - Maintenance

The model is often used in the field of human resources to help organizations identify where they are in their development and what they need to do to move to the next level.

Level 5 - Pre-contemplation

This is the first level of the model and it corresponds to the earliest stage of organizational development. At this stage, the organization is not aware of the need for change and is not considering any changes. This is typically the case with small organizations or organizations that are just starting out.

Level 4 - Contemplation

At this level, the organization is aware of the need for change but is not yet ready to take action. They are in the process of considering their options and making a plan. This is often the case with larger organizations that are established but may be facing difficult times.

Level 3 - Preparation

At this stage, the organization is ready to take action and is in the process of implementing a plan. This is typically the case with organizations that are going through a period of change or are facing a crisis.

Level 2 - Action

At this stage, the organization is actively implementing changes. This is typically the case with organizations that are undergoing a major transformation.

Level 1 - Maintenance

At this stage, the organization has made the changes and is now focusing on maintaining them. This is typically the case with organizations that have successfully undergone a major change.

The pyramid of organizational development is a useful tool for organizations to use to identify where they are in their development and what they need to do to move to the next level. It can help organizations to set goals and make plans for their future.
