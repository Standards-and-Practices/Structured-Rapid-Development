# Bowman's Strategy Clock

A Bowman's Strategy Clock is a visual tool that helps organizations map out their strategic options. It can be used to generate new ideas, evaluate existing strategies, or simply to gain a better understanding of how different strategies work.

To make a Bowman's Strategy Clock, start by drawing a circle and dividing it into eight equal sections. Label each section with one of the following options:

- Leader
- Challenger
- Nicher
- Follower
- Status Quo
- Differentiator
- Innovator
- Laggard

Once you have labeled each section, use arrows to connect each option to its closest neighbor. For example, the Differentiator option is directly between the Leader and Innovator options.

The Bowman's Strategy Clock is useful because it provides a simple way to visualize and compare different strategic options. It can also help you identify blind spots in your current strategy.
