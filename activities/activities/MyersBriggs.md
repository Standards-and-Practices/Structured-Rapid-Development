# The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator

# Getting Started

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is a personality questionnaire that assigns each person to 1 of 16 personality types. It is based on the theories of Carl Jung and helped by the work of Isabel Myers and her mother, Katharine Briggs. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has 4 dichotomies, each with 2 opposite preferences. The first dichotomy is between Extraversion (E) and Introversion (I). The second dichotomy is between Sensing (S) and Intuition (N). The third dichotomy is between Thinking (T) and Feeling (F). The fourth dichotomy is between Judging (J) and Perceiving (P). To find out your Myers-Briggs Type, you need to take a personality test. There are many different Myers-Briggs Type Indicator tests available online, so just choose one and follow the instructions. Once you know your Myers-Briggs Type, you can start to understand more about yourself and how you interact with the world. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator can be useful for choosing a career, resolving conflicts, and general self-improvement.
