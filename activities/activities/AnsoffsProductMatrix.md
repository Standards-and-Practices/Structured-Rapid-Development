# Ansoff's Product Matrix
# Getting Started

Ansoff's Product Matrix is a framework that helps businesses determine their growth strategy. There are four basic strategies that businesses can use to grow: market penetration, market development, product development, and diversification. Market penetration is when a business grows by selling more of its existing products to its existing markets. This is the most common growth strategy as it is less risky than the others. Market development is when a business grows by targeting new markets for its existing products. This can be done by expanding into new geographic markets, new customer segments, or new channels. Product development is when a business grows by offering new products to its existing markets. This can be done by introducing new variants of existing products or by developing entirely new products. Diversification is when a business grows by offering new products to new markets. This is the most risky growth strategy as it involves both new products and new markets. Ansoff's Product Matrix is a useful tool for businesses to determine their growth strategy. It helps businesses understand the risks and potential rewards associated with each growth strategy.
