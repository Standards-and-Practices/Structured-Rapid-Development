# Bodystorming

# Getting Started



What is Bodystorming?

Bodystorming is a design thinking tool that helps you come up with new ideas by acting them out physically. You can bodystorm alone or with a group, and the goal is to think creatively and come up with new solutions to problems.

How do you make a Bodystorm?

To bodystorm, you first need to identify a problem or challenge you want to solve. Once you have a problem in mind, start acting out possible solutions. There are no wrong answers in bodystorming, so let your imagination run wild! Act out as many different solutions as you can think of, and then take a step back and evaluate which ones are the most promising.

Why is Bodystorming useful?

Bodystorming is useful because it helps you think outside the box and come up with ideas you might not have thought of otherwise. It's also a great way to get feedback from others, as they can help you refine and improve your ideas. bodystorming is a valuable tool for both individuals and teams who want to be more creative and innovative in their thinking.
