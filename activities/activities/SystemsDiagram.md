System diagrams are used to show the relationships between different parts of a system. They can be used to show how a system works, or how it could be improved.

System diagrams are made up of a series of boxes, which represent the different parts of the system, and arrows, which show the relationships between the different parts. The boxes can be different sizes, to show how important each part is, and the arrows can be different thicknesses, to show how strong the relationships are.

System diagrams are useful because they can help you to understand a system, and to see how the different parts of it interact with each other. They can also help you to spot any problems with a system, and to come up with ways to improve it.
