# Rapid Prototyping

# Getting Started

Rapid prototyping is a technique that allows you to quickly create a physical model of a product or design. This can be useful for testing the design of a product before committing to manufacturing it, or for creating a model to show potential customers. There are many different ways to create a rapid prototype, but the most common method is to use a 3D printer. To create a prototype using a 3D printer, first you need to create a 3D model of your product or design. This can be done using a CAD program, or by scanning an existing physical object. Once you have your 3D model, you can then send it to a 3D printer. The printer will then create a physical model of your product or design. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the complexity of the design. Rapid prototyping can be a very useful tool for product development. It allows you to quickly test out different designs and make changes as necessary. It also allows you to create a physical model that you can show to potential customers.
