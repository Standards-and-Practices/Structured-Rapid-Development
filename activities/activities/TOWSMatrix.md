# TOWS Matrix

A TOWS Matrix is a tool used to brainstorm and plan strategic options. It forces you to consider both the internal and external environment when making decisions.

To make a TOWS Matrix, start by brainstorming all of the internal and external factors that could impact your business. Once you have a list, classify each item as a Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, or Threat. This will help you identify areas of your business that you can capitalize on, as well as areas that you need to improve.

Once you have your TOWS Matrix, you can use it to generate strategic options. For example, if you identify a Weakness as a Lack of Marketing, you could brainstorm ways to overcome that weakness, such as Hiring a Marketing Specialist or Redesigning your Marketing Materials.

The TOWS Matrix is a valuable tool because it helps you think about all of the factors that could impact your business, both positive and negative. This can help you make more informed decisions and avoid potential pitfalls.
