# Greiner Curve

A Greiner curve is a quick way to visualize growth over time. It's handy for estimating future growth or for tracking actual growth over time. Here's how to make one:

1. Draw a line on a piece of paper.

2. Make a dot at the end of the line. This will be your starting point (t=0).

3. Make a second dot at the end of the line, making sure it's further away from the first dot. This will be your ending point (t=1).

4. Connect the dots with a line.

That's it! You've now drawn a Greiner curve.

Why is this useful? Well, it's a simple way to track growth. For example, if you're tracking the growth of a company, you can plot the company's revenue on a Greiner curve. As the company grows, the line will get longer.

You can also use a Greiner curve to estimate future growth. Just extend the line beyond t=1 and see where it goes. Of course, this is just an estimate, but it can give you a good idea of what to expect.

So there you have it: a quick introduction to Greiner curves. Give them a try the next time you need to track or estimate growth.
