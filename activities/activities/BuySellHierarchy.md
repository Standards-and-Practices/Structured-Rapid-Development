# Buy-Sell Hierarchy

When it comes to running a business, there are a lot of important decisions to be made. One of those decisions is what to do with the business if something happens to the owner. This is where a buy-sell hierarchy comes in.

A buy-sell hierarchy is a documents that outlines what will happen to the business in the event that the owner dies or is otherwise unable to continue running the business. This document is important because it ensures that the business will continue to run smoothly even if something happens to the owner.

Making a buy-sell hierarchy is fairly simple. First, you need to decide who will take over the business in the event that something happens to you. This person can be a family member, a business partner, or someone else who you trust to take over the business.

Once you have decided who will take over, you need to put together a plan for how they will buy the business from your estate. This can be done through a loan, insurance policy, or some other method. The important thing is that you have a plan in place so that the business can continue to run even if you are no longer there.

There are many reasons why a buy-sell hierarchy is important. First, it ensures that the business will continue to run even if something happens to the owner. Second, it protects the owner's family from having to deal with the business if something happens to the owner. And third, it allows the owner to choose who will take over the business, instead of leaving it up to chance.
