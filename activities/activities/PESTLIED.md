# PESTLIED Analysis

# Getting Started

A PESTLIED analysis is a great tool for understanding the external factors that can impact your business. This type of analysis takes into account Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environmental factors, and can help you anticipate and plan for change. To create a PESTLIED analysis, start by brainstorming all of the external factors that could impact your business. Then, group these factors into the six categories. Once you have a good understanding of the potential risks and opportunities, you can start to put together a plan to mitigate risks and take advantage of opportunities. A PESTLIED analysis can be an extremely useful tool for businesses of all sizes. By understanding the external factors that can impact your business, you can make informed decisions about where to focus your resources.
