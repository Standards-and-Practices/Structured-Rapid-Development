# Keller's Brand Equity Model



In 1990, Kevin Keller developed the brand equity model to help businesses assess the strength and value of their brand. The model looks at three core elements that contribute to a brand's equity: brand loyalty, brand awareness, and brand image. 

Brand loyalty is the degree to which customers are committed to a brand and are likely to continue purchasing it in the future. This can be measured by things like customer satisfaction and repeat purchase rates. 

Brand awareness is the degree to which customers are familiar with a brand and can recognize it when they see it. This can be measured by things like brand recall and name recognition. 

Brand image is the degree to which customers perceive a brand in a positive light. This can be measured by things like customer attitude and brand associations. 

The Keller brand equity model can be represented visually with a pyramid. The three core elements are at the bottom of the pyramid, with brand loyalty serving as the foundation. Then, as brand awareness and brand image increase, so does brand equity. 

The Keller brand equity model is useful for businesses because it helps them understand the drivers of brand equity and what they need to do to build a strong and valuable brand. By understanding the three core elements that contribute to brand equity, businesses can create strategies to improve each one. For example, they can work to increase brand loyalty by improving customer service or by offering loyalty rewards. They can increase brand awareness by investing in advertising and marketing. And they can improve brand image by emphasizing their positive associations and downplaying any negative ones. 

Keller's brand equity model is a valuable tool for businesses of all sizes. By understanding the three core elements that contribute to brand equity, businesses can create strategies to build a strong and valuable brand.
