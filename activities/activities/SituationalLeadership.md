# Situational Leadership

# Getting Started

A Situational Leadership is a type of leadership that is based on the specific situation that the leader is in. SituationalLeadership is a great way to lead a team because it allows the leader to be flexible and adapt to the situation that they are in. To make a Situational Leadership, the leader must first assess the situation that they are in. They must then decide what type of leadership style would be most effective for that specific situation. After the leader has decided on a leadership style, they must then implement it and monitor the results. Situational Leadership is useful because it allows the leader to be adaptable. The leader can adjust their leadership style to fit the specific situation, which can help the team to be more successful.
