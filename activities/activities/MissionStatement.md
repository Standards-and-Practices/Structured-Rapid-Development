# Mission Statement



A mission statement is a brief description of what your company does, its core values, and how it plans to achieve its goals. It’s typically used as a way to attract investors, customers, and employees. 

Creating a mission statement is not as daunting as it sounds. Here are a few steps to get you started:

1. Define your company’s purpose. This is the most important aspect of your mission statement. Why does your company exist? What need does it fill?

2. Outline your company’s values. What principles guide your company’s decisions and actions?

3. Set goals for your company. What do you hope to achieve in the short-term and long-term?

4. Keep it brief. Your mission statement should be no more than a few sentences.

A mission statement is useful because it helps you stay focused on your company’s goals. It’s a rallying cry for your employees and a way to attracting customers and investors.
