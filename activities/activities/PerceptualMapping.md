# Perceptual Mapping



What is Perceptual Mapping?

A perceptual map is a graphical representation of how consumers perceive a marketplace. In particular, it shows the relationships between different products and services in the minds of consumers. The purpose of a perceptual map is to help businesses understand how consumers see the marketplace, so that they can make decisions about positioning and marketing their products and services.

How to make a Perceptual Map

There are a few different ways to create a perceptual map. One popular method is to use a graphical software program, such as Microsoft Excel. Alternatively, you can use a blank piece of paper and a pencil.

If you're using Excel, start by creating a table with two columns and as many rows as you need. In the first column, list all of the products or services that you want to include in the map. In the second column, list all of the attributes that you want to map. For example, if you're mapping brands of coffee, you might want to include attributes such as price, quality, and variety.

Once you have your table set up, it's time to start mapping. For each product, rate its position on each attribute on a scale of 1 to 10. For example, if you think that Brand A coffee is very high quality and Brand B coffee is just average, you would give Brand A a score of 10 for quality and Brand B a score of 5.

Once you have all of your ratings entered, you can create your perceptual map. To do this in Excel, go to the Insert tab and choose Scatter. Then, select the first column of ratings (the product names) for the Y values and the second column of ratings (the attributes) for the X values.

Your perceptual map will now show you how consumers perceive the different products in the marketplace. The further away two products are from each other on the map, the greater the difference in perception. For example, if two products are close together on the map, it means that consumers see them as similar. If two products are far apart on the map, it means that consumers see them as very different.

Why is Perceptual Mapping Useful?

Perceptual mapping is a valuable tool for businesses because it helps them understand how consumers see the marketplace. This information can be used to make decisions about product positioning and marketing.

For example, if you're launching a new product, you can use a perceptual map to see how it compares to existing products in the minds of consumers. This information can help you decide where to position your product and what marketing messages to use.

Perceptual mapping can also be used to monitor changes in the marketplace. For example, if you map the perception of your product over time, you can see how it changes as new products enter the market or as consumer tastes change.

Overall, perceptual mapping is a valuable tool for businesses who want to understand how consumers see the marketplace. It can be used to make informed decisions about product positioning and marketing, and it can also be used to monitor changes in the marketplace over time.
