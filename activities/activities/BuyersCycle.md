# The Buyer's Cycle

In real estate, there's something called the buyer's cycle. This is the process that a potential buyer goes through before they purchase a property. It starts with the initial search, where the buyer is looking for the right property. Once they find a few potential homes, they'll start to narrow down their options. This is where they'll start to compare prices, square footage, location, and any other factors that are important to them. Once they've found the perfect property, they'll start the negotiation process. This is where they'll try to get the best price possible. If all goes well, they'll come to an agreement and purchase the property. The buyer's cycle is important to understand because it can help you as a seller to know what a buyer is thinking and what their next move might be. It also helps you to know how to price your property and when to start negotiations. If you understand the buyer's cycle, you'll be in a much better position to sell your property.
