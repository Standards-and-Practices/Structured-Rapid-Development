# Pyramid of Purpose



Think about the last time you lost your motivation to work on a project. What was the root cause? Chances are, it wasn’t the project itself that was the problem. It was probably something else entirely.

The same is true for companies and organizations. They can lose their way when they lose sight of their purpose. This is where a Pyramid of Purpose can help.

A Pyramid of Purpose is a tool that can be used to help companies and organizations find their way back to their purpose. It is a simple way to visualize the different levels of purpose that an organization has.

The lowest level of the pyramid is survival. This is the most basic level of purpose and it is what keeps an organization afloat. The next level is success. This is when an organization starts to thrive and grow. The next level is significance. This is when an organization starts to make a difference in the world. And the highest level is legacy. This is when an organization leaves a lasting legacy.

When an organization is clear about its purpose at each level of the pyramid, it can stay focused and motivated. This is because each level of purpose serves as a North Star that can guide decision-making.

If you’re interested in creating a Pyramid of Purpose for your company or organization, here’s how you can do it:

1. Start by identifying your organization’s core values. These are the values that guide your organization’s decision-making.

2. Next, identify your organization’s higher purpose. This is the reason why your organization exists.

3. Once you have your core values and higher purpose identified, you can start to fill in the different levels of the pyramid.

4. At the lowest level, identify what is needed in order for your organization to survive.

5. At the next level, identify what is needed in order for your organization to succeed.

6. At the next level, identify what is needed in order for your organization to make a difference.

7. And at the highest level, identify what is needed in order for your organization to leave a lasting legacy.

8. Once you have identified the different levels of purpose, you can start to create goals and objectives that align with each level.

The Pyramid of Purpose is a powerful tool that can help companies and organizations stay focused and motivated. When used correctly, it can help organizations achieve their full potential.
