# Basic Interviewing

# Getting Started


A Basic Interviewing is a simple, structured way to collect information from someone. You can use a Basic Interviewing to gather information about a person's work history, education, or other qualifications.

To conduct a Basic Interviewing, you'll need to ask questions and then listen carefully to the answers. It's important to ask follow-up questions to get more information about the person's experience or point of view.

 Basic Interviewings can be useful in a variety of situations. For example, you might use a Basic Interviewing to learn more about a job candidate, to get information from a customer or client, or to gather data for a research project.
