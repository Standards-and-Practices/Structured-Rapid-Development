# Causal Loop

# Getting Started
A causal loop diagram is a visual tool used to map out cause-and-effect relationships. In other words, it helps you understand how things work by showing the how different factors can affect one another.

Making a causal loop diagram is fairly simple. First, identify the different factors involved in the system you want to understand. Then, draw arrows between these factors to show how they're interconnected. Finally, add in arrows to show the direction of the causal relationships (e.g. X causes Y).

Causal loop diagrams are useful because they help you see the bigger picture. They can also be used to test out different scenarios to see how the system might react.
