# Journey Map

# Getting Started

What is a Journey Map? A Journey Map is a graphical representation of the steps your customers take as they interact with your brand. It allows you to see the customer experience from start to finish, and identify any pain points along the way. How do you make a Journey Map? There are a few different ways to create a Journey Map. One popular method is to use sticky notes. On each sticky note, write down a different step in the customer experience, starting from the very first time they interact with your brand. Then, arrange the sticky notes in chronological order. Once you have all of the steps laid out, take a step back and look for any areas where the customer might be experiencing pain points. These could be anything from a long wait time to an unclear website. Identifying these problems is the first step to fixing them! Why is a Journey Map useful? Journey Maps are useful because they help you to see the customer experience from start to finish. This allows you to identify any problems along the way and make changes to improve the customer experience. A Journey Map is also a great tool for brainstorming new ideas to improve the customer experience. By seeing all of the steps laid out in front of you, it's easier to come up with new ways to improve things.
