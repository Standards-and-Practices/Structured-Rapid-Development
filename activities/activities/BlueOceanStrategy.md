# Blue Ocean Strategy

A Blue Ocean Strategy is a business strategy that is used in order to create new market space, rather than compete in an existing market. This is done by creating a new product or service that is not currently being offered, or by offering an existing product or service in a new way. In order to make a Blue Ocean Strategy, businesses must first understand what drives customer choice in the current market. This can be done through customer surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Once the drivers of customer choice are understood, businesses can begin to look for areas where they can create new customer value. This is done by looking for areas that are not being addressed by the current market offerings. Once an opportunity has been identified, businesses must then create a value proposition that meets the needs of customers in this new market space. This value proposition must be compelling enough to convince customers to switch from the current market offerings. Once a business has created a new market space, they will be able to enjoy many benefits. These benefits include increased profits, as there is no competition in this new market; increased market share, as customers flock to this new offering; and increased customer loyalty, as customers are more likely to be loyal to a brand that meets their needs in a new and innovative way. The Blue Ocean Strategy is a powerful tool that can be used by businesses of all sizes to create new market opportunities. It is a useful strategy for businesses that are looking to grow and expand their customer base.
