# Value Disciplines Model



The Value Disciplines Model is a tool that can be used to help organizations identify and focus on the areas that will create the most value for them. It is based on the idea that there are three essential types of value that organizations can create: operational, customer, and financial. 

Operational value is created by doing things better, faster, or cheaper than the competition. Customer value is created by offering a unique product or service that the customer perceives to be valuable. Financial value is created by generating profits or by increasing shareholder value. 

To create a Value Disciplines Model, all you need is a sheet of paper and a pen. Draw a line down the center of the paper, and label one side "operational value" and the other side "customer value." Then, on the operational value side, draw two lines perpendicular to the first, one labeled "better" and the other "faster/cheaper." On the customer value side, draw two lines perpendicular to the first, one labeled "unique product" and the other "unique service." 

The Value Disciplines Model is useful because it can help organizations to focus their efforts on the areas that will create the most value for them. It can also help organizations to identify potential areas of improvement.
