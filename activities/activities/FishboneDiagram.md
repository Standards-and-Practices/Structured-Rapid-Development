# Fishbone Diagram

If you've ever been in a situation where you're trying to figure out the root cause of a problem, you may have used a Fishbone Diagram. Also called a Cause and Effect Diagram or Ishikawa Diagram, a Fishbone Diagram is a tool used to help identify all the possible causes of a problem. This is especially useful in brainstorming sessions with a group, as it can help ensure that all potential causes are considered. A Fishbone Diagram looks like the skeleton of a fish, hence the name. The "head" of the fish is the problem that you're trying to solve, and the "bones" branch out from the head to represent all the possible causes of the problem. To create a Fishbone Diagram, start by writing the problem at the head of the page. Then, draw the bones coming out from the head. These bones can be labeled with different categories, such as "People," "Equipment," "Methods," "Materials," and so on. Under each category, write out all the potential causes that you can think of. Once you have all the potential causes listed, take a step back and look at the big picture. Are there any common themes among the causes? Are there any root causes that could be addressed to help prevent the problem from occurring? The Fishbone Diagram is a valuable tool for any problem-solver, as it forces you to think about all the possible causes of a problem and consider what the root causes might be. Give it a try the next time you're stuck on a problem!
