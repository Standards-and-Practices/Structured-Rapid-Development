Are you looking to optimize your company's purchasing strategy? If so, you may want to consider using the Kraljic Portfolio Purchasing Model.

The Kraljic Portfolio Purchasing Model is a tool that can help companies to classification of purchase items into categories, and then optimization of the purchasing strategy for each category.

There are four categories in the Kraljic Portfolio Purchasing Model:
- Leverage items: These are items that are purchased in large quantities and represent a small percentage of the total spend. For these items, the company wields a great deal of power in the negotiation with suppliers.
- Dependency items: These items are essential to the company, but the company has little bargaining power in the negotiations with suppliers.
- Strategic items: These items are not essential to the company's operations, but they can give the company a competitive advantage.
- Non-critical items: These items are not essential to the company and do not give the company a competitive advantage.

To create a Kraljic Portfolio Purchasing Model, a company will first need to map out all of the items that it purchases. Once all of the items have been categorized, the company can then develop a purchasing strategy for each category.

The Kraljic Portfolio Purchasing Model can be a helpful tool for companies because it can help to optimize the company's purchasing strategy. In addition, the categorization of purchase items can help to identify areas where the company may be able to get a better price from a supplier.
