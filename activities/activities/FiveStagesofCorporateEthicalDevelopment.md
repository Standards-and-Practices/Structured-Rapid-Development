# Reidenbach and Robin's Five Stages of Corporate Ethical Development

Most people think of businesses as being primarily concerned with making money. While it's true that businesses need to make money to stay afloat, there is more to being a successful business than just making a profit. A business also needs to be ethical in order to be successful in the long term.

The Reidenbach and Robin's Five Stages of Corporate Ethical Development is a framework that businesses can use to ensure that they are behaving ethically. The five stages are:

1. Pre-conventional
2. Conventional
3. Post-conventional
4. Reflexive
5. Transcendent

The Pre-conventional stage is where businesses primarily focus on making money. They may not be aware of or care about the ethical implications of their actions.

The Conventional stage is where businesses start to consider the ethical implications of their actions. They may have a written code of ethics and start to train their employees on ethical issues.

The Post-conventional stage is where businesses go beyond just considering the ethical implications of their actions. They actively try to do what is right, even if it goes against their bottom line.

The Reflexive stage is where businesses not only try to do what is right, but also reflect on their actions and learn from their mistakes.

The Transcendent stage is where businesses go beyond just trying to do what is right. They try to create a positive change in the world through their actions.

The Reidenbach and Robin's Five Stages of Corporate Ethical Development is a useful framework for businesses to ensure that they are behaving ethically. It can help businesses to reflect on their actions and make sure that they are doing what is right, not just what is profitable.
