# Empathy Map

# Getting Started
Think about a time when you really understood someone – what they were feeling, what they were thinking, and why they were acting the way they were. Chances are, you were able to empathize with them. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person.

The Empathy Map is a tool that can help you to better understand someone else – their thoughts, feelings, and motivations. It can be used in many different situations, such as when you’re trying to understand a customer’s needs, or when you’re trying to resolve a conflict with a friend or coworker.

Here’s how to make an Empathy Map:

1.Start by putting the name of the person you want to understand at the top of a sheet of paper.

2.Then, draw four quadrants on the paper. Label the quadrants “Thoughts,” “Feelings,” “Needs,” and “Actions.”

3.In the “Thoughts” quadrant, write down what you think the other person is thinking. This could be their surface thoughts, as well as their deeper thoughts and motivations.

4.In the “Feelings” quadrant, write down what you think the other person is feeling. This could be their emotional state, as well as any physical sensations they may be experiencing.

5.In the “Needs” quadrant, write down what you think the other person is needin. This could be their basic needs, such as food or shelter, as well as their emotional needs, such as love or attention.

6.In the “Actions” quadrant, write down what you think the other person is doing. This could be their outward actions, as well as their internal thoughts and feelings.

Once you’ve completed your Empathy Map, take a step back and look at it as a whole. What does it tell you about the other person? What can you do to better understand and support them?

Empathy Maps are a great tool to use when you’re trying to understand someone else. They can help you to see the world from their perspective, and to better understand their thoughts, feelings, and needs.
