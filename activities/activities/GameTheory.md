# Game Theory



A game theory is a tool that helps you analyze strategic situations and make decisions. It can be used in any situation where there are two or more people making decisions. 

To make a game theory, you need to identify the players, the payoffs for each player, and the rules of the game. The payoffs represent what each player gains or loses from the game. The rules of the game determine what the players can do and when they can do it. 

Once you have this information, you can start to analyze the game. You can look at the different possible outcomes of the game and see how likely each one is. You can also look at what each player would do if they knew what the other player was going to do. 

Game theory is a powerful tool that can help you understand complex situations and make better decisions.
