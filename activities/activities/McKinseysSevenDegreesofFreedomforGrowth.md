# McKinsey's Seven Degrees of Freedom for Growth

Any business looking to grow needs to have a plan for how to do so. That's where McKinsey's Seven Degrees of Freedom for Growth comes in. This framework provides a roadmap for businesses to follow as they look to expand.

There are seven elements to the framework:

1. Defining where to play
2. Selecting the right growth opportunities
3. Prioritizing initiatives
4. Capabilities
5. Organizing for growth
6. Implementation
7. Sustaining momentum

Each of these elements is crucial for businesses to consider as they look to grow. Defining where to play refers to figuring out which markets to enter and how to compete in them. Selecting the right growth opportunities means identifying which products or services to offer and which new customer segments to target.

Prioritizing initiatives is about figuring out which growth initiatives to focus on and which to let go. Capabilities refers to the skills, resources, and processes a company needs in order to successfully execute its growth plan. Organizing for growth means creating the right organizational structure and culture to support growth.

Implementation is about putting the plan into action and making sure it's executed effectively. Sustaining momentum is about maintaining growth over the long term.

McKinsey's Seven Degrees of Freedom for Growth is a powerful tool for businesses to use as they look to expand. By following this roadmap, businesses can increase their chances of success as they venture into new markets and launch new products and services.
