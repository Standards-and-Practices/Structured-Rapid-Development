A prototype is a preliminary model of something. In many cases, it is a full-scale model used for testing purposes, but it can also be a small-scale model used for demonstrations or to get feedback from potential customers. A prototype can be created using any number of methods, but the most common are to either use 3D printing or to hand-build the model using various materials such as cardboard, clay, Legos, or other similar objects. Prototyping is useful because it allows you to test out your design before committing to a final product. It also allows you to get feedback from potential customers to see if they like the design and if there are any changes they would like to see. If you are thinking about making a prototype, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, you need to decide what materials you will use. Second, you need to decide how complex your prototype will be. The more complex it is, the more expensive and time-consuming it will be to create. Finally, you need to decide what kind of feedback you are looking for. Will you be testing for function? For form? For customer reaction? Once you have a clear idea of what you want to test, you can begin to create your prototype.
