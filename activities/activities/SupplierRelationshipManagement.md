# Supplier Relationship Management (SRM)

A supplier relationship management (SRM) system is a tool used by organizations to track and manage supplier performance. By automating the process of supplier performance tracking, a SRM system can help organizations improve their supplier relationships and reduce costs.

An organization can use a SRM system to store supplier performance data, track supplier performance trends, and generate reports. The data collected in a SRM system can be used to improve supplier selection, negotiation, and contracting processes. Additionally, the data can be used to improve communication between an organization and its suppliers.

A SRM system can be created using software, such as an Excel spreadsheet, or a more sophisticated supplier performance tracking system. When creating a SRM system, it is important to consider the following:

- What data will be collected?
- Who will be responsible for collecting data?
- How often will data be collected?
- What supplier performance metrics will be tracked?
- How will the data be used?

Organizations should implement a SRM system if they want to improve their supplier relationships and reduce costs. A SRM system can help organizations track supplier performance, identify supplier performance trends, and make data-driven decisions about their suppliers.
