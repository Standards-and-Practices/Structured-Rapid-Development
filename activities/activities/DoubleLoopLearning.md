Most of us are familiar with the concept of feedback loops. A feedback loop is a process whereby the output of a system is fed back into the system as input, in order to influence the system’s behavior. There are two types of feedback loops: 1) Closed-loop feedback, which is also known as negative feedback; and 2) Open-loop feedback, which is also known as positive feedback. In a closed-loop feedback system, the feedback is used to regulate the system. That is, the feedback is used to keep the system operating within a desired range. For example, the thermostat in your home is a closed-loop feedback system. The thermostat senses the temperature of the air and turns the furnace on or off as needed to maintain the temperature within a desired range. In an open-loop feedback system, the feedback is not used to regulate the system. Instead, the feedback is used to influence the system’s behavior. For example, a microphone is an open-loop feedback system. The sound waves from your voice are converted into electrical signals by the microphone. These electrical signals are then amplified and sent to the speakers, which convert them back into sound waves. The sound waves coming out of the speakers influence the sound waves coming into the microphone, which influence the electrical signals, which influence the sound waves, and so on. Double-loop learning is a type of feedback loop that is used to improve the performance of a system by modifying the goals of the system. That is, double-loop learning is a feedback loop that is used to modify the goals of the system. For example, imagine that you are a manager and you have a goal of increasing the profits of your company. In order to achieve this goal, you implement a new production process. After implementing the new production process, you discover that it is not as efficient as you had hoped. In order to increase the efficiency of the production process, you modify the goal of the process. That is, you now have a new goal of increasing the efficiency of the production process. This new goal is what is known as a double-loop goal. Double-loop learning is useful because it allows you to modify the goals of a system in response to feedback. That is, double-loop learning allows you to adapt the goals of a system to the needs of the system. There are four steps to double-loop learning: 1) Set a goal for the system. 2) Implement the goal. 3) Observe the system and gather feedback. 4) Modify the goal in response to the feedback.
