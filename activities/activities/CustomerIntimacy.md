# Customer Intimacy



What is a Customer Intimacy?

A customer intimacy is a special, close relationship between a company and its most valuable customers. This relationship is built on trust and mutual respect, and it gives the company valuable insight into the needs and wants of its best customers. 

How to make a Customer Intimacy?

Building a customer intimacy requires developing a deep understanding of your most valuable customers. This means going beyond just collecting data about themâ€”you need to understand their motivations, their challenges, and their goals. To do this, you need to build strong relationships with your customers and really get to know them.
