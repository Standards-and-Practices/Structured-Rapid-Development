# Focus Groups



A focus group is a small, carefully selected group of people who participate in a guided discussion about a particular topic. The purpose of a focus group is to collect feedback and insights about a product, service, or issue.

To create a focus group, start by identifying your target audience and selecting a moderator. Then, invite 8-10 people to participate in the discussion. Be sure to send a confirmation email with all the details about the discussion, including the date, time, location, and any preparation required.

On the day of the focus group, start by introducing the moderator and providing an overview of the discussion. Then, allow each participant to share their thoughts and feedback. Be sure to take note of any insights or suggestions. Finally, thank the participants for their time and input.

Focus groups are an excellent way to gather feedback and insights from your target audience. They can help you identify user needs and pain points, understand how people feel about your product or service, and generate new ideas for improvement.
