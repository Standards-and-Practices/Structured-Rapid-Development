# Benchmarking

# Getting Started

A benchmark is a baseline measurement used to compare future performance to. In terms of business, a benchmark can be used to measure progress and identify areas that need improvement. To create a benchmark, you first need to decide what performance indicators you want to track. Once you have your indicators, you need to establish a baseline measurement. This can be done by collecting data over a period of time or by conducting a survey. Once you have your baseline, you can start tracking your progress and making improvements. Benchmarks are useful because they provide a way to measure progress and identify areas that need improvement. By tracking your benchmarks, you can make sure that your business is moving in the right direction.
