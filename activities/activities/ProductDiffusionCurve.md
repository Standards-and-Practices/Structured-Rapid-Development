# Product Diffusion Curve



A product diffusion curve is a graphical representation of how a new product is adopted by customers over time. The curve is typically S-shaped, with a slow start as initial adopters try out the new product, followed by a rapid growth phase as word of mouth spreads and more people catch on. Finally, there is a plateau as the market reaches saturation and the product reaches its full potential.

There are a few different ways to make a product diffusion curve. One is to simply plot the number of customers adopting the product over time. Another is to use a logarithmic scale, which can help to more clearly show the early stages of adoption.

Why is a product diffusion curve useful? It can help businesses to understand how fast a new product is likely to be adopted, and to set realistic sales targets. It can also be used to track the progress of a product over time and to identify any potential problems.
