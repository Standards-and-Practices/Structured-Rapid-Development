# Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning Model (STP)



The Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning Model (STP) is a powerful tool that companies use to market their products and services. The model is designed to help companies identify their target market, and then segment that market into smaller groups that have similar needs and wants. Once the market is segmented, the company can then choose the right positioning strategy to target each group.

There are three key steps in creating an STP model:

1. Segmentation: Dividing the market into smaller groups that have similar needs and wants.

2. Targeting: Choosing the right positioning strategy to target each group.

3. Positioning: Creating a unique and differentiated position for the company's products and services in the minds of consumers.

Why is the STP model so important?

The STP model is a powerful tool because it helps companies focus their marketing efforts on the right target market. By segmenting the market and then targeting each group with the right positioning strategy, companies can ensure that their marketing messages are reaching the right people.
