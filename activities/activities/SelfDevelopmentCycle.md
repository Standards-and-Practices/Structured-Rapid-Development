# The Self-Development Cycle
The Self-Development Cycle is a process that you can use to reflect on your personal development and set goals for yourself. It can be helpful to think of it as a wheel that you can keep spinning to continuously improve your life. To make a self-development cycle, start by identifying an area of your life that you want to work on. Once you have an area in mind, reflect on your past experiences and set a goal for yourself. After you have a goal, take action steps to achieve it. Finally, review your progress and revise your goal if necessary. This process can be helpful because it can prevent you from becoming stagnant. By continuously setting goals and reviewing your progress, you can ensure that you are always moving forward and making progress in your life. Additionally, it can be a useful tool for reflecting on your personal growth and progress.
