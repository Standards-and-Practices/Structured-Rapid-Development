# Adizes's Corporate Lifecycle



A Adizesâ€™s Corporate Lifecycle is a model that categorizes businesses based on where they are in their corporate life cycle. The model consists of four phases: Emergence, Growth, Maturity, and Decline. The phases are further divided into four stages each: Inception, Expansion, Consolidation, and Termination. 

The first stage, Inception, is when a company is founded and is working on product development and market testing. The second stage, Expansion, is when the company begins to grow rapidly, typically through aggressive marketing and sales. The third stage, Consolidation, is when the company begins to focus on efficiency and maximizing profits. The fourth stage, Termination, is when the company is no longer deemed viable and is shutting down.

The Adizes Corporate Lifecycle is a useful tool for businesses to use to assess where they are in their corporate life cycle and to make decisions accordingly. For example, a company in the Expansion stage may want to focus on aggressive marketing and sales in order to continue growing. A company in the Consolidation stage may want to focus on efficiency and profitability. And a company in the Termination stage may want to focus on winding down operations in an orderly manner. 

Understanding where a company is in its corporate life cycle can help businesses make the right decisions for their stage and improve their chances of success.
