# Five Whys method
A Five Whys analysis is a tool used to determine the root cause of a problem. The name comes from the fact that the analysis involves asking "why" five times. The idea is to keep asking why until you get to the root cause of the problem. Here's how to make a Five Whys analysis: 1.Pick a problem that you want to solve. 2.Ask "why" five times. Each time you ask "why," you should be asking about a different aspect of the problem. 3. after asking "why" five times, you should have a good understanding of the root cause of the problem. Why is this useful? The Five Whys analysis is a simple tool that can be used to quickly get to the root of a problem. It can be used on its own or as part of a larger problem-solving process.
