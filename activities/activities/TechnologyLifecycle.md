# The Technology Lifecycle



The technology lifecycle is the process that new technology goes through from inception to eventual obsolescence. The steps in the lifecycle are idea/invention, development, commercialization, adoption, and finally abandonment.

Idea/Invention: This is the phase where a new technology is first conceived. It may be the result of a single individual's brainstorming or the work of a team of researchers.

Development: Once the idea has been conceived, it must be developed into a working prototype. This phase can be lengthy and expensive, and often requires the help of experts in the field.

Commercialization: In order for a new technology to be adopted on a widespread scale, it must be commercialized. This typically involves packaging the technology into a product or service that can be sold to consumers.

Adoption: Once commercialized, the new technology must be adopted by the general public. This can be a slow process, as people are often hesitant to change their habits.

Abandonment: Eventually, all technologies become outdated and are abandoned in favor of newer, better ones. This process is natural and unavoidable.
