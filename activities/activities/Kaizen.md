A Kaizen is a Japanese method of continuous improvement. The literal translation of Kaizen is "change for better". Kaizen is based on the idea that everyone can contribute to improvement, no matter how small. There are three steps to creating a Kaizen: 1. Identify a problem or opportunity 2. Develop a plan to improve the situation 3. Implement the plan and measure the results Kaizen is useful because it helps to identify small improvements that can be made on a regular basis. These small improvements can add up to big changes over time.
