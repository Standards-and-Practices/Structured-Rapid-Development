# Insight Statements
Insight Statements are a tool that can be used to help you better understand your customers. They are based on customer data and help you to see things from the customer's perspective. To create an Insight Statement, start by collecting data about your customer. This can include surveys, interviews, customer service records, and any other data you can find. Once you have this data, start looking for patterns. What do your customers care about? What do they want? What do they need? Once you have identified some patterns, you can start to create your Insight Statements. These should be short, concise, and easy to understand. They should also be based on real data. Insight Statements can be incredibly useful for businesses. They help you to understand your customers and what they want. This can help you to make better decisions about your product, your marketing, and your overall strategy.
