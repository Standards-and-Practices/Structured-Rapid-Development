# Miles and Snow's Organizational Strategies



In 1978, Michael Miles and Charles Snow proposed a typology of organizational strategies based on two major variables: (1) defender versus prospector and (2) analyzer versus reactor.

The defender strategy is suitable for organizations operating in stable environments with well-known customer needs. The defender is focused on process efficiency and product quality, and it relies on incremental innovation to maintain its competitive advantage.

The prospector strategy is more suitable for organizations operating in dynamic environments where customer needs are constantly changing. The prospector is focused on search and experimentation, and it relies on radical innovation to maintain its competitive advantage.

The analyzer strategy is a hybrid of the defender and prospector approaches, suitable for organizations operating in environments that are somewhat stable but also have some changing customer needs. The analyzer is focused on both efficiency and search, and it relies on both incremental and radical innovation to maintain its competitive advantage.

The reactor strategy is the least suitable for any organization, as it indicates a lack of strategic direction. The reactor is focused on neither efficiency nor search, and it relies on neither incremental nor radical innovation to maintain its competitive advantage.

A Miles and Snow's Organizational Strategy (MOSS) is a framework that can be used to assess an organization's current strategy and determine which of the four basic strategies it most closely resembles. To make a MOSS, simply plot the organization's current position on the two dimensions of defender versus prospector and analyzer versus reactor.

The usefulness of the MOSS framework lies in its ability to help organizations identify their strengths and weaknesses and make strategic adjustments accordingly. For example, a company that is currently employing a prospector strategy may want to move towards a more analyzer-style approach in order to take advantage of its efficiency improvements. Alternatively, a company employing a reactor strategy might want to move in any direction in order to escape from its current lack of strategic focus.

In summary, the MOSS framework can be a helpful tool for organizations trying to assess and improve their current strategic position.
