# The Johari Window

# Getting Started

The Johari Window is a tool that can be used to help improve communication and understanding between people. It is a way of visualizing and understanding the different levels of communication that occur between people. The Johari Window is named after Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham, who developed the concept in 1955. It is also sometimes called the "Luft-Ingham" or "LI" model. The Johari Window is divided into four quadrants: Quadrant 1 is "Open" and represents information that is known to both the person and to others. Quadrant 2 is "Hidden" and represents information that is known to the person but is hidden from others. Quadrant 3 is "Unknown" and represents information that is not known to the person and is also hidden from others. Quadrant 4 is "Unknown to Others" and represents information that is known to others but not to the person. The goal of the Johari Window is to help people move information from the "Hidden" and "Unknown" quadrants into the "Open" quadrant. This can be done by increasing self-awareness and by seeking feedback from others. The Johari Window is a useful tool for individuals, groups, and organizations. It can be used to improve communication, increase understanding, and to build trust.
