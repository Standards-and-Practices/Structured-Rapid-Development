# Secondary Research

# Getting Started

A secondary research is a research method that involves the use of already existing data. This data can be sourced from already published studies, government reports, data from social media platforms, and surveys. A secondary research is conducted to gain a better understanding of a particular topic, to gather information about a population that is difficult to access, or to test a hypothesis. To conduct a secondary research, one must first identify the data sources that will be used. Once the data sources have been identified, the researcher must gather the data and organize it in a way that will be useful for the specific research project. Once the data has been gathered and organized, the researcher can begin to analyze it. There are many benefits to conducting a secondary research. Secondary research is a cost-effective way to gather data, as it requires little to no money to collect the data. Additionally, secondary research is often quicker to conduct than primary research, as the data has already been collected. Finally, secondary research can be useful in providing background information on a topic or in testing hypotheses.
