# Shareholder Value Analysis
What is shareholder value analysis? Shareholder value analysis is a tool that can be used to help make decisions about how to allocate capital within a company. It is based on the premise that the primary goal of a firm is to maximize shareholder value. How to make a shareholder value analysis There are a few different ways to approach making a shareholder value analysis. One popular method is to use a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. This approach involves estimating the future cash flows that a company will generate and then discounting them back to present value. The discount rate that is used is typically the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The value of the companyâ€™s equity is then equal to the present value of all future cash flows. This method can be used to value a company as a whole or specific projects within the company. Why is shareholder value analysis useful? Shareholder value analysis can be a helpful tool for decision-making because it forces managers to think about how their decisions will impact the value of the firm. In addition, it can help to ensure that capital is being allocated in a way that will maximize shareholder value. When done correctly, shareholder value analysis can be a valuable tool for driving shareholder value growth.
