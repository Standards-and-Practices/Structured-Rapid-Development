# Expert Interviews

If you're hoping to learn from the best of the best, then you'll want to conduct an expert interview. This type of interview allows you to speak with someone who is an authority on the subject you're hoping to learn about. When conducting an expert interview, there are a few things you'll want to keep in mind. First, come prepared with a list of questions. You should have both general and specific questions, and you should also be prepared to follow up with additional questions based on the answers you receive. It's also important to be respectful of your interviewee's time. Keep your questions focused and to the point, and be sure to thank the person for their time and insights. Conducting expert interviews can be a great way to learn about a new subject or gain new perspectives on a familiar topic. By speaking with someone who is an authority on the topic, you can get insights and information that you might not be able to find elsewhere.
