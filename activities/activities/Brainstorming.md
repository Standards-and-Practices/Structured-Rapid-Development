# Brainstorming

A brainstorming is a technique used to generate new ideas or thought about a particular topic. It is usually done with a group of people in which all members contribute ideas based on a prompt. 

 Brainstorming can be done in many different ways, but there are some common rules that should be followed in order to make it effective. The first rule is that all ideas should be welcome, no matter how far-fetched they may seem. The second rule is that all ideas should be written down, no matter how silly they may seem. The third rule is that no idea should be judged during the brainstorming session. All ideas should be treated equally.

 Brainstorming is useful because it helps to generate a lot of ideas in a short amount of time. It is also useful for getting different perspectives on a topic.
