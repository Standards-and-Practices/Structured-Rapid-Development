# Weisbord's Six-Box Model

Weisbord's Six-Box Model is a tool that can be used to help organizations analyze their current situation and identify areas that need improvement. The model consists of six boxes, each representing a different aspect of the organization: structure, leadership, task, people, rewards, and resources.

To create a Weisbord's Six-Box Model, each of the six boxes must be labeled with the corresponding aspect of the organization. Then, using a 1-10 scale, each box is rated according to how well that aspect is currently being addressed within the organization. A rating of 1 indicates that the aspect is not being addressed at all, while a rating of 10 indicates that the aspect is being addressed very well.

Once the model is complete, it can be used to identify areas of the organization that need improvement. For example, if the leadership box is rated as a 1, it indicates that there is a need for better leadership within the organization. The model can also be used to identify areas of the organization that are doing well, such as if the resources box is rated as a 10.

Overall, the Weisbord's Six-Box Model is a helpful tool for organizations to use when trying to improve their current situation. It can be used to identify areas of the organization that need improvement and also to identify areas that are doing well.
