# The Deming Cycle (PDCA)
The Deming Cycle is a continuous improvement model that is used to make small, incremental changes in a process in order to improve quality and efficiency. The cycle consists of four steps: Plan, Do, Check, and Adjust. PLAN: The first step is to identify the problem that you want to improve. DO: The second step is to implement the changes that you have planned. CHECK: The third step is to check the results of your changes to see if they have had the desired effect. ADJUST: The fourth and final step is to make adjustments to your changes based on the results of the check. The Deming Cycle is a simple yet effective tool for continuous improvement. It can be used to make small changes that can have a big impact on the quality and efficiency of a process.
