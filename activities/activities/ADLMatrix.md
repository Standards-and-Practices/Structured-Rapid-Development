# The ADL Matrix






In 1965, a man named Robert F. Mager published a book called Measuring Instructional Results. In it, he introduced a concept he called the “ ADL Matrix.”

The ADL Matrix is a tool that can be used to map out the steps required to complete a task. It is divided into four quadrants:

A – Acquisition

D – Development

L – Leverage

O – Output

The Acquisition quadrant is focused on acquiring the necessary resources to complete the task. This might include things like acquiring knowledge, skills, or materials.

The Development quadrant is focused on developing a plan or strategy for completing the task. This might include things like creating a timeline, budget, or workflow.

The Leverage quadrant is focused on using resources to complete the task. This might include things like hiring help, outsourcing, or using technology.

The Output quadrant is focused on the results of the task. This might include things like delivering a product, service, or report.

The ADL Matrix is a useful tool because it can help you to identify the steps required to complete a task and to plan accordingly. It can also help you to troubleshoot problems that arise during the completion of a task.
