# Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism

Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism is a model that can be used to help businesses capture the essence of their brand. It can be used to create a clearer picture of what a brand represents, and how that brand can be communicated to consumers.

The model is made up of six interrelated components:

# Physique

# Personality

# Culture

# Relationship

# Reflection

# Self-Image

Each component represents a different facet of the brand, and when combined, they create a three-dimensional view of the brand. This can be used to help businesses understand how consumers perceive their brand, and how to craft messages that resonates with them.

The model can also be used to evaluate how well a brand is currently performing. By looking at each component, businesses can identify areas that need improvement, and develop strategies to make the necessary changes.

Overall, Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism provides a helpful framework for thinking about brands, and how to create a strong and consistent brand identity.
