# Pilot Testing
If you've ever been in a car with someone who is learning to drive, you know that the experience can be a bit nerve-wracking. The same can be said of new software applications. To help ease the transition and iron out the bumps, many companies choose to pilot test their applications before making them generally available. A pilot test is a small-scale version of the actual application, used to gather data and feedback prior to full implementation. A pilot test can help assess feasibility, compatibility, scalability, and user acceptance. There are a few key steps to creating a successful pilot test: 1. Define the scope of the pilot test. What features will be tested? Who will be involved? What are the success criteria? 2. Set up the pilot test environment. This should be as close to the actual production environment as possible. 3. Train the users. Be sure to give them enough time to learn the new application and become comfortable with it. 4. Collect feedback. During and after the pilot test, solicit feedback from the users. This can be done through surveys, interviews, or focus groups. 5. Analyze the data. Use the feedback to improve the application before making it generally available. Pilot testing can be a valuable tool in the development process. It can help ensure that your application is ready for prime time and that your users are satisfied with the final product.
