# Guided Tour

# Getting Started

A Guided Tour is a great way to show off your website or product. It allows you to walk your audience through your site, highlighting the features and benefits that are most important to them. You can create a Guided Tour using any number of tools, but we recommend using something like Intercom's Welcome Message tool. To create a Guided Tour, simply create a series of messages that will appear on your website or product. Each message should highlight a different feature or benefit, and you can include links to more information about each topic. You can also use images and videos to help explain each concept. Once you've created your Guided Tour, be sure to promote it to your audience. You can do this through social media, email marketing, or even on your website. Simply tell your audience about the great features and benefits they'll learn about by taking the tour. Guided Tours are an excellent way to engage your audience and help them learn more about your website or product. By taking the time to create a tour, you can ensure that your audience gets the most out of your site or product.
