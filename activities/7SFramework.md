Structure 4. Systems 5. Style 6. Staff 7. Skills To create a 7S model, organizations should first identify their shared values. These are the belief systems that guide the organization's decision-making. Once shared values have been established, organizations can develop a strategy. The strategy should be aligned with the organization's shared values. After the strategy has been created, the organization can develop a structure. The structure should support the execution of the strategy. Systems are the procedures and processes that the organization uses to get work done. They should be designed to support the execution of the strategy. The organization's style is the way it does things. The style should be aligned with the organization's strategy and values. Staff are the people who work for the organization. They should have the skills and abilities to support the execution of the organization's strategy. Organizations should regularly review their 7S model to ensure that it is still accurate and relevant. The model can be adapted as the organization changes and grows. The 7S model is a useful tool for organizations because it can help them to identify areas that need improvement. It can also help organizations to develop strategies for overcome problems.
