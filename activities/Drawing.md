# Getting Started

A Drawing is a visual representation of an object, usually done in pen or pencil. To make a drawing, one must first decide on the composition, or what to include in the drawing. Once the composition is decided, the next step is to lightly sketch out the drawing using pencil and paper. After the sketch is complete, the drawing can then be inked in with a pen or other fine-tip marker. Finally, the drawing can be colored in with pencils, markers, or other media. Drawing is a useful skill for many reasons. It can be used to record an image of something for later reference, or to capture a moment in time. It can be used to communicate ideas and emotions, or simply to express oneself. Whatever the reason, drawing is a fun and rewarding activity that can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
