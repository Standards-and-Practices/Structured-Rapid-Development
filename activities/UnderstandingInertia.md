# Understanding and avoiding intertia

# Getting Started

A big part of successfully avoiding inertia is understanding what it is. Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. It's what keeps a ball from rolling forever once you give it a push, and it's what makes it so difficult to get out of bed on a cold winter morning. There are two types of inertia: mass inertia and moment of inertia. Mass inertia is the resistance of an object to changes in its velocity, or speed. Moment of inertia is the resistance of an object to changes in its rotation. In order to overcome inertia, you need to apply a force that is greater than the force of inertia. This can be difficult to do, especially if the object is large or if you're trying to change its direction of motion. One way to make it easier to overcome inertia is to make the object smaller. This will reduce the amount of force required to overcome the object's inertia. Another way to make it easier to overcome inertia is to use a lever. This will allow you to apply a force over a longer distance, making it easier to overcome the object's inertia. Finally, it's important to understand that inertia is a natural property of objects and is not always bad. In fact, without inertia, it would be very difficult to keep moving objects in motion. It's only when we try to overcome inertia that it becomes a problem.
