# Ulrich's Leadership Capital Index

# Getting Started
Ulrich's Leadership Capital Index is a measure of an individual's leadership potential. The index is based on four dimensions:

1. Charisma
2. Intelligence
3. Expertise
4. Experience

Leadership potential is evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest potential.

The index can be used to identify leaders within an organization and to assess an individual's leadership potential. It is also a useful tool for succession planning.

The index is important because it provides a way to measure an individual's leadership potential. This information can be used to make decisions about who to promote, who to develop, and who to invest in.

By understanding an individual's leadership potential, organizations can make better decisions about how to invest in their people.
