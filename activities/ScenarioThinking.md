# Scenario thinking

# Getting Started

What is Scenario Thinking? Scenario thinking is a process used to create possible future events and to explore how likely they are to occur. It helps us to think about what could happen, and what we should do in response. How to Make a Scenario There are many different ways to make a scenario, but the most important part is to make sure that it is realistic. To do this, you will need to consider both the current situation and the future trend. The current situation is what is happening now. This includes things like the current political situation, the state of the economy, and societal trends. The future trend is what is likely to happen in the future. This could be things like new technologies, changes in the environment, or political unrest. Once you have considered both the current situation and the future trend, you can start to create your scenario. You can make it as simple or as complicated as you like, but the important thing is to make sure that it is believable. Why is Scenario Thinking Useful? Scenario thinking is useful because it helps us to prepare for the future. By thinking about what could happen, we can make plans and decisions that will help us to respond to whatever does happen. Scenario thinking is also a great way to build team morale. By working together to create a believable scenario, we can all feel more prepared and confident about what the future might hold.
