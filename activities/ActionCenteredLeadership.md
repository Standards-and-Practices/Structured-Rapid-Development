# John Adair's Action-Centered Leadership model

# Getting Started

John Adair's Action-Centered Leadership model is a way to think about leadership that is based on three key elements: tasks, goals, and people. To create an action-centered leadership model, you need to first identify the tasks that need to be done, the goals that need to be met, and the people who need to be involved. Once you have these three things identified, you can start to create a plan of action that will help you achieve your goals. The Action-Centered Leadership model is useful because it helps you to focus on the most important aspects of leadership. By identifying the tasks, goals, and people who are most important to your success, you can create a plan that will help you achieve your objectives.
