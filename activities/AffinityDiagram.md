# Affinity Diagram

# Getting Started
An affinity diagram is a tool used to organize ideas or information. It's similar to a mind map, but instead of starting with a central idea and branching out, you start with a bunch of ideas and then group them together. This can be helpful when you're trying to identify patterns or find relationships between ideas. 

To make an affinity diagram, start by writing down all of your ideas on sticky notes. Then, group together the sticky notes that are related. You can do this by putting them next to each other, or by drawing lines between them. After that, give each group a name. Once you've grouped together the related ideas, you can start to see patterns and relationships. 

Affinity diagrams can be helpful when you're brainstorming, or when you're trying to make sense of a bunch of information. By grouping together related ideas, you can start to see the big picture.
