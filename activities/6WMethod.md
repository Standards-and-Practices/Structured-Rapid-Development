# 6W Method

# Getting Started


Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you're not sure what to do next? Maybe you're feeling overwhelmed by a project, or you've hit a roadblock in your work. The 6W Method can help you figure out what to do next.

The 6W Method is a simple framework that you can use to analyze a problem and come up with a plan of action. It's called the 6W Method because it involves answering six questions:

1. What is the problem?

2. Who is affected by the problem?

3. What are the potential causes of the problem?

4. What are the possible solutions to the problem?

5. What are the risks and benefits of each solution?

6. What is the best way to implement the chosen solution?

Answering these six questions will help you figure out what to do next. Let's look at each question in more detail.

1. What is the problem?

The first step is to identify the problem. What are you trying to accomplish? What is preventing you from accomplishing it? What are the consequences of not solving the problem?

2. Who is affected by the problem?

Who will be affected by the problem? This includes people who are directly affected by the problem, as well as those who will be affected indirectly.

3. What are the potential causes of the problem?

There may be more than one cause of the problem. Try to brainstorm all of the potential causes, even if they seem unlikely.

4. What are the possible solutions to the problem?

Once you know the causes of the problem, you can start to brainstorm possible solutions. There may be more than one solution to the problem.

5. What are the risks and benefits of each solution?

Before you choose a solution, it's important to consider the risks and benefits of each option. What are the risks of each solution? What are the potential benefits?

6. What is the best way to implement the chosen solution?

Once you've chosen a solution, you need to come up with a plan for how to implement it. What are the steps you need to take? Who needs to be involved? What resources are required?

Making a 6W Method is a simple way to figure out what to do next. It's a helpful tool to use when you're feeling overwhelmed or stuck. By answering these six questions, you can develop a plan of action and move forward.
