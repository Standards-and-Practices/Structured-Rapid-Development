# Design Thinking

# Getting Started

Design Thinking is a structured process for creative problem solving. It is used to find innovative solutions to complex problems. The process is composed of five steps: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. 

**Empathize**: The first step is to understand the problem from the user's perspective. This step is important because it allows you to see the problem from a different perspective and to identify potential user needs. 

**Define**: The next step is to define the problem. This step is important because it allows you to focus on a specific problem and to develop a clear goal. 

**Ideate**: The third step is to generate ideas. This step is important because it allows you to brainstorm potential solutions to the problem. 

**Prototype**: The fourth step is to create a prototype of the solution. This step is important because it allows you to test the feasibility of the solution. 

**Test**: The final step is to test the prototype. This step is important because it allows you to validate the effectiveness of the solution.
