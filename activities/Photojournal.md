# Photojournal

# Getting Started

A photojournal is a record of events that is preserved as a sequence of photographs, typically with accompanying text. It can also be created with other forms of visual media, such as video or illustration. The term "photojournal" was first coined in the 1930s. A photojournal can be used to document personal events, such as a wedding or vacation, or to capture the essence of a place or thing. Photojournalism is a type of journalism that uses photos to tell a news story. It is an important part of news reporting. To make a photojournal, you will need a camera, tripod, and photo editing software. Once you have these items, you can start taking pictures and organizing them into a sequence. When you have finished taking pictures, you can add text to explain what is happening in each photo. Why make a photojournal? A photojournal can be a great way to preserve memories and share them with others. It is also a useful tool for storytelling.Photojournalism can help people understand complex issues by providing a visual account of what is happening.
