# The EFQM Model

# Getting Started

The EFQM Model is a framework for excellence that can be used by any organization, in any sector, to improve their performance. It is a non-prescriptive model that can be adapted to any organization's needs, and it is based on the premise that all organizations have the potential to improve. The model is made up of nine elements: - Leadership - Strategy - People - Partnerships and Resources - Processes - Customers - Results - People Development - Business Results Each element has a number of indicators that can be used to assess how well the organization is doing in that area. The model also has four levels of achievement: - Foundation - Recognized - Leading - Exemplary Each level has a different set of requirements, and organizations can use the model to assess their current level and identify areas for improvement. Making a EFQM Model is relatively simple and can be done using a variety of methods. One popular method is to use a software tool, such as Q-Pulse, which will guide you through the process and help you to create a model tailored to your organization's needs. Whatever method you use, creating a EFQM Model is a valuable exercise for any organization. It can help you to identify areas of excellence and identify areas that need improvement. It is also a useful tool for benchmarking your performance against other organizations.
