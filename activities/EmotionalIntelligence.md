# Emotional Intelligence

# Getting Started

We all know intelligence comes in many different forms. There’s mathematical intelligence, verbal intelligence, and emotional intelligence, to name a few. Emotional intelligence is different from IQ in a few key ways. Namely, emotional intelligence has more to do with our ability to perceive, understand, and manage emotions. This might sound like a soft skill, but emotional intelligence is actually a hard skill that can be measured, improved, and mastered. So what is emotional intelligence? Emotional intelligence is the capacity to be aware of and manage one’s own emotions, and the emotions of others. It’s about being attuned to emotions and using that information to guide your thoughts and actions. Why is emotional intelligence important? Because it’s essential for success in both our personal and professional lives. Good emotional intelligence can help you in your relationships, your career, and your overall wellbeing. How can you improve your emotional intelligence? Here are a few suggestions: 1. Be aware of your emotions. The first step to managing your emotions is to be aware of them in the first place. If you’re not attuned to your emotions, it’s hard to manage them. Pay attention to how you’re feeling throughout the day and why you’re feeling that way. 2. Practice emotional regulation. Once you’re aware of your emotions, the next step is to learn how to regulate them. This doesn’t mean suppressing your emotions or stuffing them down. It means finding healthy ways to express and cope with your emotions. 3. cultivate self-awareness. In addition to being aware of your emotions, it’s also important to be aware of your thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. Why do you think and act the way you do? What motivates you? The more aware you are of yourself, the better able you’ll be to manage your emotions. 4. Be attuned to others. Just as important as self-awareness is awareness of others. This includes being able to read other people’s emotions and understanding how your own emotions affect others. 5. practice empathy. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. It’s an important skill for managing emotions because it allows you to see the world from another person’s perspective and understand their feelings. 6. Manage stress. Stress is a normal part of life, but it can be debilitating if not managed properly. Learning how to manage stress is an important part of emotional intelligence. 7. Seek out social support. Social support is essential for managing emotions. When you have a strong supportive network, you have people to turn to when you’re feeling down or struggling to cope. Improving your emotional intelligence takes time and effort, but it’s worth it. The benefits of emotional intelligence are far-reaching and long-lasting. So if you want to improve your relationships, your career, and your wellbeing, start working on your emotional intelligence.
