# Porter's Value Chain

# Getting Started

What Is a Porter’s Value Chain? A Porter’s value chain is a model that helps managers to identify the major sources of cost and differentiation within their firm. It is based on the work of Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School, and is also known as a “Porter’s generic competitive strategy.” The model is made up of two main parts: 1. Primary activities 2. Support activities Primary Activities The primary activities are those that are directly related to the creation or delivery of the product or service. In other words, these are the activities that create value for the customer. The main primary activities are: 1. Inbound logistics 2. Operations 3. Outbound logistics 4. Marketing and sales 5. Service Support Activities The support activities are those that are indirectly related to the creation or delivery of the product or service. In other words, these are the activities that help to create value for the customer, but are not directly involved in doing so. The main support activities are: 1. Procurement 2. Technology development 3. Human resources 4. Firm infrastructure How to Create a Porter’s Value Chain There are a few steps you can follow to create your own Porter’s value chain: 1. Draw a horizontal line down the center of a piece of paper or whiteboard. 2. On the left side of the line, list all of the primary activities. 3. On the right side of the line, list all of the support activities. 4. For each activity, list the associated costs. 5. For each activity, list the associated differentiating factors. Why Is a Porter’s Value Chain Useful? A Porter’s value chain is useful because it can help managers to: 1. Understand the sources of cost within their firm 2. Understand the sources of differentiation within their firm 3. Develop strategies for reducing costs and/or increasing differentiation 4. Monitor changes in costs and/or differentiation over time This model can be particularly helpful for managers in a manufacturing company, as it can help them to identify ways to improve the efficiency of their production process and reduce costs.
