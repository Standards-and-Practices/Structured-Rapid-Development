The Eisenhower Decision Matrix is a simple tool that can be used to help you make planning decisions. It is based on the premise that there are four types of activities: important and urgent, important and not urgent, not important and urgent, and not important and not urgent.

## How To Use The Matrix
Here are instructions on how to use the Eisenhower Decision Matrix:

1. Identify the activities that you need to do.

2. Categorize each activity as important and urgent, important and not urgent, not important and urgent, or not important and not urgent.

3. Decide which activities you will do, and in what order.

4. Take action and do the activities that you have decided to do.

## Prioritizing The Quadrants

**Urgent and Important** activities should be given the highest priority because they are time-sensitive and require immediate attention. 

**Not Urgent But Important** activities should be given the second highest priority because they are important but can be scheduled for a later time. 

**Urgent But Not Important** activities should be given the third highest priority because they are not as important as other activities but still need to be completed in a timely manner. 

**Not Urgent and Not Important** activities can be eliminated because they are not important and do not need to be completed in a timely manner.
