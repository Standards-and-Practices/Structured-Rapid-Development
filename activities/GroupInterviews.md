# Group Interviews

# Getting Started

A group interview is an interview in which a group of candidates are interviewed at the same time. It is usually used to assess qualities such as teamwork and communication. To make a group interview, the interviewer will first need to decide on the qualities they would like to assess. They will then need to create a set of questions that will assess these qualities. Finally, they will need to gather a group of candidates and conduct the interview. Group interviews can be useful for employers because they can assess multiple candidates at the same time. They can also be useful for candidates because it can give them a chance to see how they work in a group setting.
