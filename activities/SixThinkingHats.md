# Six Thinking Hats

# Getting Started

A Six Thinking Hats is a tool for thinking about problems from different perspectives. It can be used to generate new ideas, to find solutions to problems, or to make decisions. To make a Six Thinking Hats, you will need six pieces of paper, each a different color. On each piece of paper, write down one of the following perspectives: 

White Hat: Facts and figures. 
Red Hat: Emotions and intuition. 
Black Hat: Criticism and skepticism.
Yellow Hat: Optimism and hope. 
Green Hat: Creativity and new ideas. 
Blue Hat: Organizing and thinking about the problem. 

Once you have all six pieces of paper, put them in a hat or other container. Then, when you need to think about a problem from a different perspective, reach into the hat and pull out a piece of paper. Whatever color you draw, that is the perspective you should think about the problem from. The Six Thinking Hats is a useful tool because it forces you to think about problems from multiple angles. It can help you to generate new ideas, or to find solutions to problems that you might not have considered otherwise.
