# Process Management

# Getting Started

A process management is a tool that helps you track and monitor all the task completed by your team. This can be extremely useful in keeping your team organized and on track. To make a process management, you'll first need to decide what tasks need to be completed, and then break those down into individual steps. Once you have a list of all the steps required to complete a task, you can assign each step to a specific team member. You can then track the progress of each task by monitoring the completion of each step. If a task is taking longer than expected, you can quickly see where the bottleneck is and take steps to fix it.
