<p>Practice is one of the most effective skill-building strategies for learners of all abilities. Well-designed opportunities for practice encourage proficient, accurate, and reliable demonstration of skills. Practice helps learners master foundational skills and build toward higher order thinking and application of learning in varied contexts.</p>

<p>But poorly designed practice opportunities can have detrimental effects by promoting rote memorization, reinforcing narrow skill development, and frustrating under-performing learners.</p>

<h2 id="intent">Intent</h2>
<p>This pattern involves a series of progressively more difficult practice sets with formative feedback. After a possible diagnostic or pre-test, each set begins with simple Knowledge Check activities with rich automated feedback.  Skills development modules ensue (all potentially optional). The Practice is followed by the summative assessment. If the Practice has been taken seriously, summative assessment scores should be Perfect (or perfect enough).
Practice Makes Perfect works really nicely for more skills-based classes where you are preparing students for high stakes assessments, especially those addressing formulas, math, and vocabulary. Accounting, Anatomy, Chemistry, Economics and Statistics courses do really well in this pattern.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Motivation is viewed as the pivotal and activating component. Ericsson et al. viewed motivation as a prerequisite for sustained engagement in deliberate practice over weeks, years and even decades. While intrinsically motivated individuals are typically the most committed to their domain of expertise commitment to deliberate practice is one of the factors that distinguish skilled participants from other individuals who may struggle to meet lesser practice demands (Csikszentmihalyi et al., 1993; Ericsson et al., 1993).</p>

<h2 id="applicability">Applicability</h2>
<p>Deliberate practice is practice that intentionally aims at improving oneâ€™s skills and competencies. It is not a mechanical or repetitive process of making performance more fluid. Instead, it involves a great deal of thinking, problem solving, and reflection for analyzing, conceptualizing, and cultivating a developing performance. This includes directing and guiding future training efforts that are then fine-tuned to dynamically evolving levels of performance (Lehtinen, Hannula-Sormunen, McMullen &amp; Gruber, p. 1, 2017).</p>

<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p>When we practice something, we are involved in the deliberate repetition of a process with the intention of reaching a specific goal. The words deliberate and intention are key here because they define the difference between actively practicing something and passively learning it (Sterner, 2012).</p>
