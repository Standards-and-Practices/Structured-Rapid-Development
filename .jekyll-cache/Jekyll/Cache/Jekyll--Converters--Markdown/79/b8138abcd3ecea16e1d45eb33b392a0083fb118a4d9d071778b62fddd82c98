<p>In their article, The Many Levels of Inquiry, Heather Banchi and Randy Bell (2008)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> clearly outlines four levels of inquiry.</p>

<h2 id="level-1-confirmation-inquiry">Level 1: Confirmation Inquiry</h2>

<p>The teacher has taught a particular science theme or topic. The teacher then develops questions and a procedure that guides students through an activity where the results are already known. This method is great to reinforce concepts taught and to introduce students into learning to follow procedures, collect and record data correctly and to confirm and deepen understandings.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-structured-inquiry">Level 2: Structured Inquiry</h2>

<p>The teacher provides the initial question and an outline of the procedure. Students are to formulate explanations of their findings through evaluating and analyzing the data that they collect.</p>

<h2 id="level-3-guided-inquiry">Level 3: Guided Inquiry</h2>

<p>The teacher provides only the research question for the students. The students are responsible for designing and following their own procedures to test that question and then communicate their results and findings.</p>

<h2 id="level-4-opentrue-inquiry">Level 4: Open/True Inquiry</h2>

<p>Students formulate their own research question(s), design and follow through with a developed procedure, and communicate their findings and results. This type of inquiry is often seen in science fair contexts where students drive their own investigative questions.</p>
