<p>Well-structured problems require the application of a finite number of concepts, rules, and principles being studied to a constrained problem situation. These problems have been referred to as transformation problems (Greeno, 1978), which consist of a well-defined initial state (what is known), a known goal state (nature of the solution well defined), and a constrained set of logical operators (known procedure for solving) (Jonassen, 2000, p. 67).</p>
